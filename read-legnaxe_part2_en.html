                <div class="prose prose-lg dark:prose-invert max-w-none text-justify">
                    <p>The consequence of the Broken Veil (or perhaps, Healiangel's own paradoxical act of sacrifice to patch it up with a hybrid entity) is not just the scars of war on the angel's wings or the heavy silence that replaces the eternal harmony. It is a deeper rift, a leakage of chaotic energy that even the purest light of Heaven cannot fully heal. The sky of the heavenly realm was no longer infinitely blue, but variegated with strange dark patches, where the void energy from the outside was still smoldering. The common light of Heaven, the source of life for all creation here, is weakening, its pulse becoming weak and uncertain.</p>
                    <p>In the Great Hall of Light, which was once the center of power and glory, it was now enveloped by an atmosphere of mourning. The angels, from the fiery Seraphim to the cherubim guarding, both the faithful and the fallen who had just witnessed the fall of Lucifer's leader, gathered in silence. The splendor of the past is only a memory. Fear, an emotion alien to the angelic being, is now clearly present in every eye, every trembling of the wings. They looked at each other, at the cracks in the energy that were spreading on the crystal walls that were once as solid as eternity, and at the common light that was fading like a lamp in the wind. A silent, anguished question echoes in everyone's mind: Where is the Creator? Why is He silent in the face of the approaching decline?</p>
                    <p>At that moment, as if in response to that silent and desperate prayer, the Throne in the center of the Great Hall suddenly lit up. But this time the light was no longer a dazzling, majestic aura that made all creatures bow down. It has an unusual tenderness, a warm pale yellow but tinged with a melancholy expression, a hint of the fatigue of millennia of observation and waiting. God is present, not with absolute power to crush everything, but as a Father who watches his children go astray after destroying his own home.</p>
                    <p>His voice rang out, not the thunder of an order, but a vast, deep whisper that permeated the entire universe. It does not resound from a specific direction, but as if it is the air, the light that remains, is speaking, touching the depths of every soul trembling with fear and hope.</p>
                    <p>"I have given you freedom, the most precious gift, the foundation of conscious existence itself. I give it not for you to submit blindly, but for you to create your own destiny, learn by experience, and grow in your own light. I have given you knowledge, a double-edged sword, so that you can distinguish between good and evil, so that you can understand the value of choice. I have given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, countless times, even to the first traitor, the one who bears the light but chooses the darkness."</p>
                    <p>His voice stopped for a beat, a heavy silence that seemed to contain the disappointment of a Creator. His sigh seemed to shake the whole of Heaven.</p>
                    <p>"But the balance is still broken. Freedom, without responsibility and humility, inevitably leads to chaos. Power, if not guided by love and understanding, will eventually become an instrument of destruction. You have seen the consequences. You have tasted the price of pride and blindness."</p>
                    <p>The light from the Golden Throne softened a little more, becoming as fragile as the last candle of the night. The last message took shape.</p>
                    <p>"Now, I give you the final lesson, the greatest challenge, the only opportunity to truly understand the meaning of what I have given: the Earth. A finite world, a particle of dust in the middle of the vast universe, but it contains the complexity and beauty of fragile life itself. Where joy and pain always go hand in hand like day and night. Where life and death are two sides of the same coin, part of the eternal cycle that you, the immortals, have never really understood."</p>
                    <p>His voice became more earnest, like a trusting mandate but also a stern one.</p>
                    <p>"Let's go down there. Forget about wings and power. Learn to exist as the flesh-and-blood weak creatures you once despised. Learn to love when immortality is no longer the fulcrum, when every moment becomes precious. Learn to find the light in the finitude itself, in the darkness of suffering, in the small daily choices between good and evil. It was the last school. Where you have to face your own naked self, where you have to prove the true worth of your soul, not by strength, but by maturity."</p>
                    <p>And then, the last words sounded, not a farewell, but an affirmation of a new era of freedom and responsibility:</p>
                    <p>"From now on, the choice and the consequences are entirely yours. I will step back and observe your growth in true freedom."</p>
                    <p>Finishing his words, the bright light on the Throne did not go out completely, but shrunk, withdrawing from his direct expression. It is no longer the sun that illuminates every corner, but becomes a distant aura, a latent presence, like the heart of the universe still beating but no longer involved in every breath. The feeling of God's almighty, direct presence disappears from Heaven.</p>
                    <p>Along with that retreat, the divine energy that once nurtured and maintained the perfect order of Heaven also stopped flowing directly. This loss is like air being withdrawn from the chest, like warmth suddenly leaving in the middle of a cold winter.</p>
                    <p>A deadly silence, heavier than before, enveloped the Great Hall. Then, the real collapse began. With no more direct divine energy sustained, the great structures of Heaven began to waver. The sound of shattering sounded from everywhere. The towers of light faded and cracked. The crystal walls, a symbol of eternity, appear countless deeper cracks. The symphony of the heavenly realm is silent, replaced by chaotic, out-of-tune sounds of disintegration and terror.</p>
                    <p>The initial fear turned into extreme panic. The angels screamed, scattered in vain, trying to hold on to the last bit of order that was disintegrating like dust.</p>
                    <p>Michael roared in despair, the golden sword in his hand was only a faint light. He tried to gather the remaining Archangels: "Hold the ranks! Protect the center! Don't panic!" But his orders were lost in the midst of chaos. His power, which had been nourished by God's light, was now severely weakened. Gabriel stood still, the silver staff in his hand faded, and the golden eyes looking up at the Throne were now just an empty building, filled with despair.</p>
                    <p>In the far reaches of the abyss, Lucifer also felt this shocking change—the retreat of the Supreme Light. A half-smile flashed on his lips - the opportunity had come? But then he sensed the widespread instability, the chaos was not limited to Heaven. This retreat means that all old laws are broken. A universe without the direct intervention of the Creator... Was it really the freedom he wanted, or was it an even more terrifying chaos?</p>
                    <p>The answer came almost immediately.</p>
                    <p>The sky above Heaven was collapsing, and even the Hell above was shaking, suddenly torn apart by an invisible force. A huge space crack, black and deep, opened up like an eye of the universe looking down. It emits neither light nor darkness, only a terrifying, invisible attraction, which begins to pull everything towards it – the glittering fragments of the Heavenly structures, the panicked souls, both the lingering light and the darkness of the abyss.</p>
                    <p>Heaven is really disintegrating. And a fateful rain is about to fall.</p>

                <h3>Chapter 2: Soul Meteor Shower</h3>
                <p>The huge space rift above Heaven and Hell is more than just a portal to nothingness. It is an open wound of the universe, an extreme point of imbalance where reality is torn apart, and now, it begins to "bleed" chaotic energy.</p>
                <p>The terrifying attraction from the crack impacted the energy bodies of the remaining creatures in Heaven that were disintegrating. A storm of primordial energy, frenzy and chaos began to form, swirling around the mouth of the crack like a cosmic whirlwind. This is not the Creator's deliberate wrath, but a natural consequence, a cold rebalancing mechanism of the universe when the core stable energy has receded, leaving a void and a severe imbalance. The universe is trying to "heal" itself with chaos and regeneration.</p>
                <p>The storm of energy roared from the crack, its sound being the screech of crushed souls, the cracking sound of space-time itself. It swept through the dying Heaven.</p>
                <p>Not all of them were swept away. Michael, with his iron will and the remaining power, stood in the midst of the storm, trying to protect what was left of Heaven. Lucifer, from his hiding place (possibly Hell), observed the event with cold calculation, not directly affected by this storm.</p>
                <p>But not everyone is so lucky. Healiangel, the Healer, who had just experienced the trials and transformations of the Veil, perhaps because his being had become more hybrid and more sensitive to chaos, or simply fate, had been caught up in the heart of the storm. Along with him, were a handful of other angels who were probably near the crack, or simply not strong enough to resist the terrible attraction.</p>
                <p>When caught up in the frenzied energy, the divine essence of Healiangel and the ill-fated angels began to be torn apart. Pure light is blended in, crushed into particles of basic energy. The wings disappeared like ashes. The aura shattered. Most painfully, memories – millennia of existence, knowledge of the universe and ontology – are erased and mercilessly washed away by the chaotic energy. Their characteristic powers, especially Healiangel's healing abilities, are deprived, neutralized, returning to their original latent energy state.</p>
                <p>It is a "whitewashing" of the soul, a forced and brutal "reset" for those who are caught up.</p>
                <p>Healiangel felt his being torn apart, the pain of disintegration even greater than when he faced the Broken Veil. His characteristic jade light flashed one last time in despair and then disappeared, leaving only the purest ray of energy, carrying the seeds of compassion, severely damaged, swept into the chaotic flow along with a few other rays of light from the reluctant angels.</p>
                <p>From the giant crack, these chaotic rays of energy – fragments of the soul that have been bleached, deprived of everything but the most essential essence – begin to shoot out into space like a strange, beautiful but tragic meteor shower. They did not fall into the void, but were pulled back by the gravitational pull of a small, blue planet in the distance.</p>
                <p>Earth.</p>
                <p>The Spirit Meteor Shower, carrying Healiangel and a handful of other unknown angels, began to pour down on the peaceful planet, where humanity was still living its finite life, unaware that they were about to receive reluctant visitors, the seeds of a new turbulent era. where the angels who have lost their memory will have to relearn the lesson of being human.</p>
                <p>These soul entities, after being deprived of their essence and memory, have been reduced to basic and latent forms of energy. They do not dissipate into the void but follow a directional gravitational force, descending on planet Earth. Here, they are expected to begin a new cycle of existence through rebirth, endowed with a physical form and a different life cycle, thereby absorbing essential knowledge and lessons in an environment that is considered harsh and challenging.</p>

                <h3>Chapter 3: Heaven and Heaven After the Event</h3>
                <p>The Soul Meteor Shower, a consequence of the cosmic imbalance after God retreated, brought Healiangel and a handful of other angels down to Earth. These souls, bleached in memory and power, begin a new life in strange forms, on strange lands, like seeds waiting to sprout in the "earthly school".</p>
                <p>The countryside of Vietnam, a rainy night.</p>
                <p>The wind whistles through the fibrous roof of the small house at the end of the village. Mrs. Lan, a widowed woman with an austere face but her eyes still shining with kindness, is patching up her old shirt under the creeping oil lamp. Her only son died in a flash flood last year, leaving her alone in an empty house. The sound of rain falling on the veranda adds to the loneliness.</p>
                <p>Suddenly, a strange noise sounded outside the courtyard. It was not the sound of thunder, nor the sound of broken branches. It was like the sound of something soft falling on the moist ground. Curious and a little afraid, Mrs. Lan held an oil lamp and opened the door to look out.</p>
                <p>In the midst of the rain and darkness, a faint, gentle jade green glow was emanating from an old cloth wrap near the base of the star fruit tree. The light was not dazzling, but extraordinarily warm and pure. Mrs. Lan slowly approached, her heart pounding. She unfolded the fabric.</p>
                <p>A newborn baby.</p>
                <p>He was tiny, his skin was pale, and his breath was fragile as if it was about to turn off. But what stunned Ms. Lan was her eyes. Her eyes were wide open, she didn't cry, she wasn't afraid, she just looked at her quietly. A deep, clear, calm jade green color like the surface of a autumn lake, hiding a sadness and wisdom that does not seem to belong to a newborn child. The strange light from earlier seemed to emanate from those same eyes.</p>
                <p>"Oh my God... Where are you?" Mrs. Lan whispered, her voice trembling. She hurriedly held the baby in her arms, feeling its small, cold body. "Poor child..."</p>
                <p>She carried the baby into the house, gathered the fire, carefully dried it, and wrapped it in her warmest towel. The baby remained silent, her jade eyes did not leave her.</p>
                <p>"I'm too weak," Mrs. Lan rubbed while making some diluted rice water. "But you have very beautiful eyes. Well, heaven has brought you to me, I will raise you. I'll call you Hael... Mom's Hael."</p>
                <p>The child seemed to understand, blinking slightly. The blue light in his eyes faded slightly, as if hidden deep inside. Hael, the reincarnated Healiangel, begins his mortal journey in the arms of a poor but loving mother.</p>
                <p>London, United Kingdom and Los Angeles, United States.</p>
                <p>Unlike Hael and the unknown angels who were caught up in the storm, Lucifer was not a victim of the Soul Meteor Shower. The Fallen, after being exiled to Hell, always sought to escape his captivity or influence on the realms. The fact that God receded and the Veil weakened was the golden opportunity he had been waiting for. With his remnant dark powers and inherent cunning, he has found an opening, a way to be present on Earth—not a rebirth of a memory loss, but a deliberate intrusion.</p>
                <p>He chose the form of a human, recreated his deadly charm, and chose the name Lucifer Morningstar as an arrogant assertion of his being. He was not born into a mundane family, but perhaps used his power to create a perfect cover – a mysterious young master from an ancient family in England, with an unknown source of finance. The broken wing-shaped scar on his back could have been a remnant from an old battle, or a detail he had deliberately retained.</p>
                <p>And he chose Los Angeles as the stage. The city of temptations, where man displays the most naked desires. He opened Lux, not just for business, but to observe, to manipulate, to find pleasure in the complexity of humanity, and perhaps, to find a new purpose in the absence of God's direct intervention. He remembered who he was, remembered everything that had happened.</p>
                <p>The confrontation with investor Thompson at Lux is a good example of how he operates in this world.</p>
                <p>"Mr. Morningstar," he said arrogantly. "I think you should know your location..."</p>
                <p>Lucifer smiled, his eyes flashing with ancient understanding and power. "You know, Mr. Thompson," he said, his voice weighty. "The interesting thing about Los Angeles is, the location can change very quickly... an offer that cannot be refused."</p>
                <p>Thompson had a chill down his spine at the piercing gaze and the invisible pressure emanating from Lucifer. It was not the echo of power, but the active use of the power of the Fallen One's essence, even though it was limited to human form.</p>
                <p>"I... I think we can renegotiate. Uncle... What do you want?"</p>
                <p>Lucifer was pleased. "See? Everything can be solved with a civilized conversation." He enjoyed this power game. Humans are predictable. But he also felt a curiosity. Will the other "fragments" from Heaven fall here as interesting as he thought? Especially Healiangel?</p>
                <p>Heaven after the incident.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, in Heaven that was slowly cooling, Michael was still standing. He was not swept away, but faced with an even more difficult reality: a Heaven that had lost the direct guidance of its Creator. The throne was empty not because He disappeared, but because He chose to step back and observe.</p>
                <p>For Michael, who always lived by absolute command and justice, this "silent observing" meant neglect, a test that he believed the remaining weak angels could not overcome. The fear of chaos and outright collapse motivated him to seize power.</p>
                <p>"Listen!" Michael's voice echoed. "God has stepped back, giving us the right to make our own decisions. But look! That freedom is leading to chaos! He was wrong to trust these weak people! Order must be re-established, by My will, to replace His silence of observation!"</p>
                <p>He tightened his discipline, turning Heaven into a cold fortress. Anyone who shows weakness or skepticism is punished in the name of "Justice" and "Order." Absolute power, no longer the reflection of God, began to eat away at his soul, turning him into an authoritarian ruler, even though he still believed in his heart that he was doing the right thing to save Heaven. He looked down at Earth with contempt, seeing it as a harbor for the failed and the weak.</p>
                <p>A new beginning.</p>
                <p>The two souls that were at the center of the cosmic war are now on Earth, but in two completely different states. Hael embarks on a mortal journey from nothing, with shattered memories and loving instincts. Lucifer, full of consciousness and memory, actively immerses himself in the human world in search of a new purpose or a new pastime. In Heaven, Michael is creating a new order based on fear and power.</p>
                <p>The three roads have turned out clearly. The "earthly school" opened its doors to Hael and other unknown angels. The Los Angeles stage was ready for Lucifer's performance. And Heaven is entering a new era under Michael's rule. The complex destiny of the three realms has indeed begun.</p>

            <div class="chapter" id="chapter-4">
                <h3>Chapter 4: The Call of Compassion</h3>
                <p>Years in the peaceful village passed, and Hael was now a young man of almost twenty years. Although he still had a slender and pale appearance compared to the strong young men in the village, he was no longer as weak as before. Thanks to Mrs. Lan's dedicated care and perhaps partly thanks to the fresh climate, his health has become more stable. Ms. Lan is still healthy, her small grocery store is enough for the mother and daughter to live through the day. Hael often helped his mother look after the shop or followed the village healers to learn about medicinal plants, a job that suited his health and quiet, observant nature.</p>
                <p>Life seemed to pass peacefully. Hael still kept a certain distance from everyone, still felt that he was a "lodging" in this world, but his love for Mrs. Lan was real, his attachment to this land was real. He was still sensitive to the pain of others, still seeing the invisible "cracks" around the seriously ill or the elderly, but he accepted his helplessness, seeing it as part of a finite human life. The incident with the sparrow in the past was only a vague memory, a strange dream he couldn't explain.</p>
                <p>Until a fateful afternoon.</p>
                <p><strong>Vietnamese Village - Unexpected Disaster.</strong></p>
                <p>That year's rainy season came earlier and was more intense than usual. The water of the Cai River rises and flows rapidly. The rickety bamboo bridge across the river, the only road connecting the village to the outside, has become dangerous. That afternoon, a group of children in the village were playing near the river bank when suddenly, a flash flood came from upstream. The roar of water drowned out the sound of rain. The bamboo bridge shook and collapsed in a muffled scream. The children playing on the bridge were swept away by the fierce flood waters.</p>
                <p>"Help! Help!" Crying and screaming echoed throughout the river.</p>
                <p>Villagers rushed to the riverbank, but no one dared to plunge into the rushing water. Hael and Lan also ran out. Looking at the chaotic scene, looking at the small arms reaching in the middle of the murky water, Hael's heart seemed to be suffocated by someone. The familiar helplessness rose again, but this time, it was accompanied by an urge to act more intensely than ever.</p>
                <p>He saw a little girl, the neighbor Hua who used to play with him, being swept away by the water towards the sharp rocks. Her face was pale with fear, and her faint cry was almost drowned out by the sound of the flood. Next to her, the "crack" of death appeared clearly, black and spreading rapidly.</p>
                <p>Without further thought, Hael plunged into the water.</p>
                <p>"Hael! Don't do it!" Mrs. Lan screamed in despair, but it was too late.</p>
                <p>Hael's weak body was almost instantly swept away by the current. But with an extraordinary will, he still tried to swim towards baby Hoa. The flood water was bitterly cold, swept away by mud, and tree branches hit his body painfully. He felt his strength running out, and his breathing became difficult. But when he saw Baby Hua's desperate gaze, a strange energy suddenly surged from the depths of his chest.</p>
                <p>He stretched out his hand, trying to grab Hoa's small hand that was reaching out. The moment his hand touched her hand, a brilliant emerald green light, many times stronger than when he saved the sparrow, burst forth from Hael's body. The light formed a faint aura, pushing the roaring flood water away from the two of them in an instant. Baby Hua, who was fainting, suddenly opened her eyes, looking at Hael in amazement. The bruises on her body from the impact seemed to fade.</p>
                <p>But Hael didn't feel it. He only felt a pain tearing through his heart as if his soul had been withdrawn, and all his strength was gone. His mind was spinning, his eyes darkened. Before he fainted, he only had time to push baby Hoa to the shore with all his strength, where the villagers had time to use bamboo poles to pull her up. Then he fainted, swept away by the floodwaters.</p>
                <p>When Hael woke up, he found himself lying in a familiar house, surrounded by Mrs. Lan and the villagers, worried. He was only slightly bruised and exhausted, luckily pushed by the water to the shore and rescued in time. Baby Hoa is also safe. But the memory of the blue light, the feeling of energy surging and then disappearing, about the pain of tearing the intestines and liver became vague, flickering like a dream. He only remembered that he had rushed down to save people and then fainted.</p>
                <p>"I'm awake! Thank you, Buddha!" Mrs. Lan hugged him tightly, sobbing. "You're too risky, Hael! You can't be like that next time, right?"</p>
                <p>Hael just kept silent, looking out the window. He felt scared. Fear of the floodwaters, fear of death, and fear of yourself. Something wasn't right going on inside him, a power he didn't understand and couldn't control.</p>
                <p><strong>Heaven - absolute power.</strong></p>
                <p>At the same time, in the cold Heaven, Michael was standing in front of the remaining angels. He has just issued a new law: any expression of excessive emotion, any skepticism about the new order will be considered treason and severely punished.</p>
                <p>A low-level angel, looking tired, timidly spoke up: "Archangel General, whether... Should we be more concerned about the souls who have fallen to Earth? They used to be our brothers..."</p>
                <p>Michael turned around, his eyes as cold as ice. The golden sword at his side shook slightly. "Brothers? The weak and the failed are not my brothers! The Earth is a place of chaos, a failed lesson of freedom. It is our duty to protect this remnant purity of Heaven, at all costs! Discipline is power! Order is Justice! Whoever mentions those mortals or fallen souls will be subject to My judgment!"</p>
                <p>The angels bowed their heads silently, not daring to look directly at Michael. The atmosphere became even heavier and suffocating. Absolute power is turning Michael into the very thing he fought against.</p>
                <p><strong>Los Angeles - The hunt begins.</strong></p>
                <p>In his lavish penthouse overlooking Los Angeles, Lucifer was reviewing reports from a network of henchmen around the world. He glanced at information about politics, economics, war... are all boring and predictable.</p>
                <p>"Isn't it interesting?" He asked the assistant who was waiting for orders.</p>
                <p>"Sir, there have been a few reports of anomalous energy phenomena in some remote areas, and some cases of ordinary people suddenly possessing strange abilities after 'dying and coming back to life' or having an accident..."</p>
                <p>Lucifer raised his eyebrows, and a smile of interest appeared. "Oh? Abnormal energy? Strange possibilities? It seems that the 'rain' of the past has left some interesting 'seeds'." He stood up and walked towards the large window. "Focus on those reports. Especially places with signs of... pure light. Find us those special individuals. Maybe this 'earthly school' is going to have some more interesting lessons."</p>
                <p>His eyes flashed with calculation. Life in LA is starting to get boring, it's time to stir things up a bit. And finding fallen angels, especially Healiangel, seems like a good start.</p>
                <p><strong>Change.</strong></p>
                <p>On Earth, Hael was trembling at the latent power that had just burst out. In Los Angeles, Lucifer began the hunt. In Heaven, Michael squeezed power. Three fates, three worlds, although separate, but the invisible thread of destiny has begun to tighten...</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chapter" id="chapter-5">
                <h3>Chapter 5: Between the Flow of People and the Hidden Corners of the Soul</h3>
                <p>The terrible incident on the bank of the Cai River that year left an indelible scar on Hael's soul. He saves little Hoa, but the price is extreme exhaustion and an obsession with the mysterious jade green light, the moment he touches the boundary between life and death. He was afraid of himself, afraid of the uncontrollable energy that was sleeping somewhere inside. The feeling of being lost and different from the villagers became even more profound. They looked at him with eyes that were both admiring and apprehensive after that incident. Unable to face the gazes and unanswered questions, as well as to escape his own confusion, Hael decided to leave the village when he was just an adult. He went to the city, immersed himself in the flow of unknown people, hoping that the noise and bustle of the city would help him forget or at least overshadow the scary mysteries about himself.</p>
                <p><strong>In the middle of the flow of people - daytime masks:</strong></p>
                <p>Hael chooses jobs in the hospitality industry – hotel receptionists, restaurant waiters, bus ticket salesmen – where he can come into contact with hundreds of faces a day but doesn't need to connect deeply with anyone. That's how he sees the human world. learn about their complex emotions, while keeping a safe distance. He still kept a calm appearance, his jade eyes were calm but there was an extraordinary empathy. The ability to see the "cracks" in others is still there, as a constant reminder of the fragility of human life and your own helplessness.</p>
                <p>Mr. Nam, the manager of the hotel where Hael worked the longest, often shook his head at his special employee. "This little Hael is good-natured, hardworking, but he's like a man in the clouds," he told his wife. "Working hard all day, but the nose is always worried, and it's even good to give money to poor customers. I don't know what he thinks."</p>
                <p>Mai, the receptionist colleague, was more straightforward. "Brother Hael, tell me the truth, you just live in a closed house forever and don't feel lonely? Sometimes you have to open your heart!"</p>
                <p>Hael just laughed. He knew they cared, but how could he explain how he felt like an "innkeeper", about the shattered images that came back from time to time, about the terrifying energy he felt every time his emotions ran high? He was afraid of scaring them, afraid of being seen as crazy. Therefore, he chose to be silent, putting on the mask of a gentle, quiet boy.</p>
                <p><strong>Hidden Corners of the Soul - Seeking Artificial Liberation:</strong></p>
                <p>But that mask becomes too cramped at night. The boredom of repetitive work, the pressure of hiding oneself, the feeling of being lost in a sea of people, and a vague fear of oneself pushed Hael to find other "escapes". He plunged into the all-night fun like a burner, not out of real desire, but out of a desperate need to feel something different, to touch limits, or simply to temporarily forget who he really was.</p>
                <p>He could sit idly in a noisy casino, looking at the dancing numbers, feeling the fake thrill of those who were betting their fortunes. He could take part in dangerous street car races, feeling the wind whistling in his ears, speed, and death just around the corner. He could sit in a casual bar, drinking wine like plain water—the high-altitude alcohol of humans seemed to be unable to touch his special body. He was always the "False Saint", the most sober among his drunken friends, quietly watching them laugh and talk, cry, quarrel with a cold indifference.</p>
                <p>"Why are you never drunk, Hael?" A drinking friend asked softly, putting his arm around his shoulder. "It's always like that stone statue, bored to death!"</p>
                <p>Hael only took one more sip of wine, the bitterness did not make him drunk, only made the feeling of emptiness inside more pronounced. Are you trying to fit in, or are you punishing yourself? He didn't know.</p>
                <p>Once, after a late-night car race, a friend in the group unfortunately had a serious accident, his limbs were scratched, and he was bleeding a lot. Everyone panicked. Hael, instinctively, was the first to run over. He helped his friend up, his hand unconsciously touching the largest wound that was bleeding. A familiar feeling, a slight warmth spread from his hand. He hurriedly withdrew his hand, frightened.</p>
                <p>The next morning, the friend woke up in the hospital, surprised to find that his wound was dry and the pain was unbelievably relieved. He tried to remember what had happened last night, but the image of Hael at that time became very vague. "Hael... it did something strange... but... I don't remember it well," he told others.</p>
                <p>And Hael, after that night, felt his tired body disintegrate, and the memory of Lan's mother's smile seemed to fade a little more. The cost of using latent energy, however unconscious, is becoming more and more obvious and frightening. The more he tried to run away from himself, the more he was held back by it.</p>
                <p><strong>Heaven & Los Angeles – Parallel Moves.</strong></p>
                <p>In Heaven, Michael received a report of unusual energy fluctuations on Earth, but he brushed it off. "It's just the chaos of mortals and fallen ones. Not worth worrying about. Focus on internal purification!" He ordered Gabriel and Uriel to watch more closely than the rest of the angels.</p>
                <p>In Los Angeles, Lucifer receives more detailed reports about Hael, including rumors about him never getting drunk and strange "healings" happening around him. "Interesting," Lucifer smirked. "There is both the compassion of a saint and the self-destructive behavior of a sinner. Healiangel, you've changed a lot. Or perhaps, you're trying to find yourself again in a very... people." He decided to speed up the approach plan. "Prepare the plane. I think it's time for a business trip to Southeast Asia."</p>
                <p>His eyes flashed with calculation. Life in LA is starting to get boring, it's time to stir things up a bit. And finding fallen angels, especially Healiangel, seems like a good start.</p>
                <p><strong>Lost.</strong></p>
                <p>Hael stood alone on the rooftop of the hotel after his shift, looking down at the noisy traffic below. He felt more lost than ever. During the day, he is a dedicated servant, trying to ease the pain of mortality. At night, he is a reckless seeker of oblivion in dangerous amusements. Who are you between those two people? The jade-green light that flashed from time to time in his subconscious and the eyes of the people he helped me, what did it mean? He didn't know. He only felt the burden getting bigger and bigger, and a vague premonition that this false peaceful life was coming to an end.</p>

                <h3>Chapter 6: The Shadow of Charity</h3>
                <p>Hael's life continues in persistent contradictions. During the day, he is a dedicated service boy, trying to soothe the pain of mortality with small gestures, even though his heart always feels helpless before the invisible "cracks" he sees. At night, he is a lost person who seeks oblivion in dangerous pleasures, only to wake up with a tired body and an increasingly empty mind, the memories of Lan's mother or the strange blue light fade a little. He seemed to be trapped between two worlds, not belonging to any place at all.</p>
                <p><strong>Unexpected appearance.</strong></p>
                <p>On a weekend morning, when Hael was helping Mr. Nam take inventory of the books at the hotel front desk, a jet black limousine, so luxurious that it was lost, quietly parked in front of the door. All eyes in the small hall were focused on the car. The car door opened, and Lucifer Morningstar stepped down. Still a branded suit without a single wrinkle, meticulously groomed black hair, and a half-smile full of charm but hidden something unpredictable. His temperament radiated a strong attraction, making the people around him unconsciously hold their breath.</p>
                <p>He was not accompanied by a bodyguard, only an assistant dressed in polite business clothes followed. Lucifer rolled his eyes around the hotel lobby, his gaze stopping exactly where Hael was standing, even though he was trying to cower behind the counter.</p>
                <p>"Good morning," Lucifer said, his deep English voice sounding clearly in the midst of an unusually quiet space. "Can I meet Mr. Hael?"</p>
                <p>Mr. Nam hurriedly walked out, somewhat confused. "Yes... Yes, sir. This is Hael." He pushed Hael forward slightly.</p>
                <p>Hael looked up, facing the mysterious man. Lucifer's deep black eyes stared at him intently, not missing a single detail—from his slender physique, pale skin, to his distinctive jade-colored eyes gleaming with surprise and vigilance.</p>
                <p>"Nice to meet you, Hael," Lucifer smiled, holding out his hand. "I'm Lucifer Morningstar. I've heard a lot about you."</p>
                <p>Hael shook his hand hesitantly, feeling a slight electric current and an indescribable cold sensation from that perfect hand. "You... are you looking for me?"</p>
                <p>"That's right," Lucifer nodded, retracting his hand naturally. "I happened to know the story of your kindness and bravery, especially during the flash flood a few years ago. I really admire young people like you who dare to act for others."</p>
                <p>He said sincerely, but his eyes flashed with cold calculation as he observed Hael's reaction. "It's still that look," he thought to himself. "Healiangel's eyes, filled with compassion but also full of innocence. It's perfect to get started."</p>
                <p>"I run a charity," Lucifer continued, his tone becoming more intimate. "And we are looking for projects and individuals who deserve to support in this area. When I heard about you and the community here, I thought I should come and see it myself."</p>
                <p>He gestured to the assistant. The assistant immediately placed a thick document on the counter.</p>
                <p>"This is our proposal," Lucifer said. "The Morningstar Foundation wants to fund a significant amount of money to upgrade the facilities of this hotel, where he works, as well as to support part of the medical expenses for the elderly who are lonely in his village. And for you, Hael, we want to give you a full scholarship, so that you can pursue any discipline you want, to reach your full potential."</p>
                <p>The offer was like a bomb exploding in the middle of the hotel lobby. Mr. Nam opened his mouth, speechless. Mai, the receptionist, who was standing nearby, was also stunned. Helping the whole hotel, the villagers, and a full scholarship for Hael? This is too good to be true.</p>
                <p>Hael was the most confused. He looked at the documentary, and then looked at the man in front of him. This generosity is too great, too sudden. His instinct told him that something was wrong, but reason was tempted. He thought of Lan's mother, to the villagers who were struggling, to the patients he helplessly watched them suffer. This opportunity can change everything.</p>
                <p>"Why... Why are you so good to me and everyone?" Hael asked again, his voice trembling, trying to find the truth in those black eyes.</p>
                <p>Lucifer laughed softly, a smile that made it easy to believe. "Why? Because I like to do good, Hael. And because, as I said, I see in you a special potential, an unusual light. I want to help that light shine. It's that simple." He leaned forward slightly, lowering his voice. "Think about this offer. There is no need to rush to answer. My people will get back to you."</p>
                <p>Saying that, Lucifer turned around and leisurely stepped out of the waiting car, leaving Hael, Mr. Nam, Mai and the entire hotel lobby in surprise and a chaotic atmosphere.</p>
                <p><strong>Heaven - Surveillance Order.</strong></p>
                <p>Michael receives a report from Uriel about Lucifer's unusual presence and philanthropy in a remote countryside in Vietnam, near where a strange energy oscillation was previously recorded.</p>
                <p>"What is he playing?" Michael frowned. "Charity? The Fallen One does charity?" He didn't believe in Lucifer's kindness, but he didn't understand his purpose either. "Keep an eye on him. And that area too. If there is any indication that he is trying to interfere with the 'lesson' of the fallen souls, report it to Me immediately. I will not allow him to break the fragile order on Earth, even though He has chosen to stand out." He still despised what was happening on earth, but Lucifer's arrival made him wary.</p>
                <p><strong>Los Angeles - With Mồi.</strong></p>
                <p>Sitting on a private plane back to LA, Lucifer smiled contentedly. The play was a great success. Hael took a bite. His innocence, compassion, and difficult circumstances were perfect weaknesses.</p>
                <p>"The observation phase is over," he thought. "Now is the time to approach and 'nurture' that potential. See where your limits are, Healiangel. See if your kindness can be bent into something... more interesting than not." He ordered his network to begin implementing "philanthropic" activities in Vietnam, while also seeking to bring Hael closer to him, be it an offer to work at one of his charities, or an opportunity to study abroad. The prey was in sight.</p>
                <p><strong>Confusion.</strong></p>
                <p>Hael held the Morningstar Foundation's proposal in his hand, his heart heavy. The opportunity to change his life was right in front of him, not only for him but also for the people he loved. But the uneasy hunch about the man named Lucifer Morningstar has not disappeared. What choice do you have to make? Accept this "shadow of charity", or continue with your lost but peaceful life? This decision is even more difficult than facing flood waters every year.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chapter" id="chapter-7">
                <h3>Chapter 7: Choice in the Night</h3>
                <p>Night fell. The sound of rain falling evenly tapped the dull rhythm on the corrugated iron roof of the hostel. In the small, damp room, the golden light surged Hael's shadow on the patchy wall. He sat motionless, his intricate jade-colored eyes staring at the thick pile of documents on the table—the flashy proposal from the Morningstar Foundation. An utopian "treasure" in the middle of the mortal world, a promise of life that he had never dared to dream of, lying there, both inviting and burning.</p>
                <p>Hael's mind whirled between hope and doubt. The image of Lan's mother with thin shoulders, a gentle smile but deep traces of time. The money could not only rebuild the roof and buy tonics, but also bring her the peace of old age. Then the children in the shelter, the lonely old people in the village with the invisible "cracks" of disease and despair that he could only helplessly see. This offer was a golden opportunity for him to really make a difference, so that the deep compassion within him would no longer be an empty torment. An opportunity to escape from the confines of life, to learn, to explore the world, and perhaps, to discover yourself. A glimmer of excitement, a feeling of being empowered to change the fate of not only his own but also the people he cares about.</p>
                <p>But immediately, a stream of cold air ran down his spine. Lucifer Morningstar. The half-mouth smile was full of implications, and the abyss-like black eyes seemed to see through every hidden corner. This generosity came too easily. Does a "treasure" come with an exorbitant price? A hunch told him that this was a dangerous game, a delicious bait impregnated with a sophisticated poison.</p>
                <p>Memories suddenly rushed back, intertwined between strength and fear:</p>
                <p>The jade-green light blazed violently around him and Little Hoa in the middle of the flood water – a strange power.</p>
                <p>The body disintegrates when he wakes up, the memory of the light is vague like a dream—the price of that power.</p>
                <p>The feeling of emptiness to the extreme in the midst of the noisy silver – the escape from the essence.</p>
                <p>The flow of warmth faded when she touched her friend's wound, in exchange for fatigue and a cold void in her memory of her mother—the accompanying loss.</p>
                <p>Hael shuddered. Accepting this offer meant getting closer to the power that both blessed and cursed within him. Will he be able to control it, or will he be swallowed up by it, taken advantage of for dark purposes? The feeling of "innkeeper" rises again. But this time, it comes with another question: if you're already a boarder, why not choose a better place to live, one where you can actually do something meaningful, even if it's only temporarily? The temptation of opportunity is too great.</p>
                <p>He picked up the phone and called Lan's mother. Her voice on the other end of the line, amid the sound of pouring rain, was still unusually warm. "Son," she said after listening to him, her voice lowering, "I know you've always wanted to help people. Such a good opportunity is indeed rare. But Hael, kindness without wisdom is easily exploited. That man... I already felt uneasy when I heard you. You have to think carefully, don't be greedy for immediate benefits." His mother's advice was both a fulcrum and a deep swirl of contradictions in Hael's heart.</p>
                <p><strong>Heaven.</strong></p>
                <p>The Great Hall of Light was cold and desolate. Michael stood on the steps of the makeshift throne, his cold eyes watching the army of angels move with mechanical discipline. The general light is weak, just enough to clearly illuminate the cracks that are spreading on the crystal walls. Uriel approached, his face calm. "Governor, there is a report from Earth. Lucifer Morningstar approached Healiangel. He made an offer of funding and scholarships." Michael smirked, a scornful smile. "Healiangel? Who has been swept away in a storm of chaos because of his own weakness?" His voice echoed, cold. "Has he accepted the Fallen One's almsgiving?" "There is no final decision yet, Mr. President." "Hmm," Michael turned away. "A healing angel is confused by the trivial material temptations of mankind. It's disappointing! He is no longer worthy of our attention. Let him decide his own lowly fate in that 'earthly school'." His eyes were hard, without a hint of sympathy. "Focus on maintaining order here!" Gabriel stood not far away, silently bowing his head, his silver wings trembling slightly. He heard the scorn in Michael's voice. A vague fear rose for the fate of his old brother on earth, but he did not dare to speak up. Heaven now has no room for compassion.</p>
                <p><strong>Return to Hael's motel room.</strong></p>
                <p>The sound of the rain had stopped. Hael stood up, walked to the window overlooking the dark alley. The decision took shape, a complex choice between a desire for change, the appeal of opportunity, and a vague fear of the cost. He picked up the phone again and called Lucifer's assistant. His voice was even, trying to hide the chaos inside. "I accept the offer," he said, word for word as a deliberate compromise. "But I have the conditions..." He made a request to choose his own school and was allowed to return to visit the village, a last-ditch effort to retain some autonomy, to show that he was not completely passive in entering the game. On the other end of the line, a professional voice rang out, agreeing with suspiciously ease.</p>
                <p>The call ends. Hael let go of the phone, leaning against the cold wall. He chose. The door to an uncertain future has opened, bringing with it both the light of opportunity and the darkness of danger. He knew that he had just set his first foot on a path that could not turn back. A deep sense of insecurity enveloped him, but this time, there was a faint glimmer of hope for change.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chapter" id="chapter-8">
                <h3>Chapter 8: Entering the New World</h3>
                <p>The day Hael left, the sky was not raining, but it was heavy with a lead gray. The farewell took place quietly in front of the dilapidated house. Mrs. Lan didn't cry much, only her eyes were red, and her thin hands trembled to stroke the folds of Hael's worn shirt. She put in his hand the last piece of thorn leaf cake, the gift of the countryside that he still loved. "Take the road to stay healthy, baby," she choked up. "Don't forget your mother, don't forget this village." Hael hugged her mother's thin shoulders tightly, trying to inhale the familiar scent, trying to engrave this image in her mind, an invisible fear that this warm memory would eventually fade like smoke. He couldn't say a word, just nodded, his throat choked bitterly. He promised to call often, to visit as soon as he could, but deep down in his heart, he clearly felt that an invisible distance was growing, not just geography. Turning his back and walking, he didn't dare to look back, afraid that he wouldn't have the courage to leave the only embrace that really belonged to him.</p>
                <p>The luxury car sent by the people of the Morningstar Foundation took Hael straight to a high-end apartment complex in the center of magnificent Saigon. Far from a damp motel room or a simple cottage, his new residence is a modern, comfortable serviced apartment with large glass doors overlooking the bustling city. Hael stands in the middle of a spacious living room, between shiny surfaces and expensive furniture. A part of him, who was too accustomed to deprivation, couldn't help but be overwhelmed by this sudden luxury. The opportunity to study, a better life, a "treasure" that he had never dared to dream of, was now unfolding in front of him. But the bright crystal light exuded a cold feeling, and the sterile perfection of this place made him feel strange. The feeling of "innkeeper" quickly returned, more intense. This is not home. This is a gorgeous, gilded cage, but it's still a cage.</p>
                <p>The people of the Morningstar Foundation, who always appear with standard smiles and polite business attire, help him arrange his new life. They signed him up for crash English classes, gave him instructions on how to use modern equipment, and took him shopping for some new clothes — things he had never thought of before. They give him a chance with both hands, but their smiles never seem to reach the bottom of his eyes. Hael felt the implicit surveillance behind that almost perfect thoughtful cover. They knew exactly when he left the house, when he came back. Once, an employee even accidentally mentioned details in a private conversation between him and Lan's mother over the phone, making Hael's spine cold. He caught a glimpse of the familiar black car that had taken him from the countryside to the bottom of the building a few times, and then quickly merged into the traffic.</p>
                <p>In order to "help Hael integrate and gain experience", the Foundation arranged for him to work part-time at their representative office. The work is not strenuous, mainly handling paperwork, interpreting simple documents, and sometimes accompanying other employees on field trips to funded projects.</p>
                <p>During a trip to visit a loving home for orphans in the suburbs, Hael once again faces the earthly pain that he is both afraid and compelled to touch. In the midst of the innocent children, he noticed a thin girl sitting alone in the corner of the yard, her big round eyes looking into the distance. A faint "crack", a sign of deep hurt, existed around her, as if it was gently vibrating, inviting healing. Compassion is like an electric current running through Hael's body. He wanted to walk over, he wanted to put his hand on those trembling little shoulders, he wanted to soothe the pain in those eyes. The instinct screamed inside him.</p>
                <p>But then the image of the Rolling Cai River, the feeling of exhaustion fades, and the fear of shattered memories comes back as a cold warning. His hands clenched, his nails pressed deep into his palms to the point of blood. You can't! You don't dare! The price was too high - the very pieces of memories of his mother, the only warmth he ever knew. He could only quietly approach, sit down next to her, and clumsily hand her the last sugar candy left in his pocket. She looked up at him, her eyes still gloomy but a little more surprised. Helplessness and self-reproach were like a rock weighing down Hael's chest. He turned away, not daring to look directly into those clear eyes anymore.</p>
                <p><strong>Los Angeles.</strong></p>
                <p>In a luxurious office on the top floor of the Lux building, Lucifer smiled contentedly as he looked at the report and the photos sent back from Vietnam. Especially the moment when Hael struggles internally and decides not to touch the orphan. The large screen in front of him showed Hael sitting alone in the apartment, his face hidden in darkness. "Great," he whispered, twirling the whiskey glass in his hand. "The fear has begun to take root. Let compassion and helplessness torment him. When a healing angel does not dare to heal, he will begin to doubt his own being. And that's when I can reshape him at will." He took a sip of wine, his eyes flashing with the excitement of the hunter who was cornering his prey into the corner of the wall.</p>
                <p><strong>Heaven.</strong></p>
                <p>Michael's eyes were still watching the angel armies who were practicing non-stop in the Great Hall. The sound of metal colliding with each other was dry and cold. Reports of Hael's repression in the home of love only add to his contempt. "Weakness and fear. He had completely lost his angelic nature. There's nothing worth worrying about." Gabriel stood behind him, and hearing that cold comment, his heart sank. He looked down at the distant Earth, where his old brother was struggling alone in the dark, targeted by both Heaven and Hell. But he could only sigh in silence, his silver wings drooping helplessly.</p>
                <p>Night fell again. Hael sits alone in a lavish but unusually empty apartment. The city lights outside were bright, promising many things, but they could not illuminate the loneliness and confusion in his heart. He had entered a new world, seized a chance to change his life, but the feeling of being lost and imprisoned was even more pronounced. The road ahead was blurry, full of invisible pitfalls under a flashy cover, and he didn't know if he had the strength, or rather the courage, to face it. He looked at his hands, wondering if they still had the ability to bring healing, or if there was only a trembling of fear left.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chapter" id="chapter-9">
                <h3>Chapter 9: First Lessons</h3>
                <p>Hael's new life gradually entered the reels. The initial overwhelm at material comforts and open opportunities subsided, giving way to a more sophisticated sense of emptiness. The high-end apartment is still unfamiliar, and the work at the Morningstar Foundation, although not hard, makes him feel suffocated by the cold professionalism and the feeling of being constantly monitored. The calls to Lan's mother became less and less frequent, not because he had forgotten, but because the distance between the two worlds was getting bigger and bigger, and the confidants became difficult to say.</p>
                <p>The work at the office brought Hael more exposure to the Foundation's "charity" activities. He is tasked with helping screen applications for help, participating in partner meet-ups and sometimes flashy fundraising events. Lucifer seemed to want him to see the "true face" of the world he was manipulating.</p>
                <p>At a fundraiser held at one of the city's most luxurious hotels, Hael, dressed in a suit prepared by the Foundation, felt out of place among the lavishly dressed elite crowd. They laughed, toasted, pledged great donations to the less fortunate, but their eyes were full of calculation, conversations revolving more about business than true compassion. He found the Foundation's project manager tactfully rejecting a difficult case that did not bring media benefits, while prioritizing another project that could polish the name of the major donor. The naked fake made Hael feel nauseous. It was far from the simple, sincere kindness he had known back home.</p>
                <p>He quietly retreated to the balcony, looking down at the brightly lit city. The cold indifference he had tried to maintain in self-defense seemed to be validated by this world. Is kindness just a luxury, a tool for exchanging benefits? That thought made him both bitter and a little bit... strangely relieved. If the world works like this, then your disorientation, your separation, may not be completely meaningless.</p>
                <p><strong>Heaven.</strong></p>
                <p>In a corner where the little bit of the warm light of Heaven was slowly cooling, near where the Curtain was still smoldering faint cracks, Gabriel stood silent, his eyes looking at the Earth. His golden wings drooped, no longer as glorious as before. Beside him, Uriel, the Archangel of Wisdom, with an unpredictable calm face, was also contemplating. "Can you feel it, Uriel?" Gabriel asked softly, his voice full of worry. "Lucifer's influence is spreading around Healiangel. He's being dragged into a spiral of falsehood and skepticism." Uriel nodded slowly, his deep eyes staring into the void. "I see. The Fallen is doing his lesson in his own way. He wanted to prove that even the purest soul could be tainted by the material world and the complexity of the human race." "We can't stand and watch!" Gabriel was frustrated. "Michael... He was so focused on order that he forgot compassion. He sees Healiangel as a failure, but I believe he still has the light inside!" "Your compassion is precious, Gabriel," Uriel replied, his voice even but containing ancient wisdom. "But don't forget, this is an 'earthly school'. Each soul must face the challenge on its own, find the way on its own. Our intervention now could break the lesson Healiangel needs to learn. Even the Creator has chosen to step back and observe." Gabriel clenched the silver staff in his hand, his gaze still not leaving the blurry image of the Earth. He knew that Uriel was right, but the messenger's heart was still heavy with worry for the brother who was fighting alone down there.</p>
                <p>Michael, looking down at the exchange between the two Generals from above, only smirked slightly and then turned away, continuing to supervise the steel discipline of the angel army. To him, Gabriel's weakness and skepticism were just as despicable as Healiangel's fall.</p>
                <p>Returning to the apartment after the party, Hael felt tired, disintegrated, not because of work, but because of the chaotic emotions inside. He sat by the window, watching that the rain had started to fall again. Suddenly, an image flashed through his mind—not clear, just an unusually warm feeling spreading from his chest, a soft blue light, and the pure laughter of Lan's mother a long time ago, when he was a weak child held in her arms. The fragile memory flashed and faded, leaving him with a vague regret and longing for a lost purity.</p>
                <p>At that moment, his phone rang. A message from an unknown number, but sent through the Morningstar Foundation's internal system. "Hi Hael, I'm in charge of your scholarship program. Mr. Morningstar is very impressed with his progress and would like to invite him to Los Angeles in the near future to discuss his study plans and visit the Foundation's headquarters. All expenses will be covered. Please let us know your convenience."</p>
                <p>Hael read the message over and over again, his heart pounding. Los Angeles. Head office. Meet Lucifer Morningstar. The Fallen One's invisible hand was outstretched, pulling him closer. He knew this was a dangerous turn, but at the same time, an irresistible curiosity also arose. Is it time to face the person behind it all?</p>

                <h3>Chapter 10: The Trip to Los Angeles</h3>
                <p>After several days of inner struggle, between irresistible curiosity and vague insecurity, Hael decided to accept the invitation to Los Angeles. He told himself that this was an opportunity to better understand the Morningstar Foundation, his academic plans, and more importantly, to face, if only indirectly, the mysterious man who was slowly dominating his life. The last call to Lan's mother was brief, he only said that he had an important business trip related to the scholarship, trying to hide the real destination and anxiety in his voice.</p>
                <p>The long flight across the Pacific Ocean was a completely new experience for Hael. Sitting in the comfortable business class cabin arranged by the Foundation, he looked through the small window and saw the ground and the clouds receding behind him. It feels like you're floating in mid-air, detached from everything familiar. An ancient soul trapped in a modern machine, flying towards an uncertain future. He closed his eyes, trying to find peace, but his mind was invaded by disjointed images: the faint blue light, the sad eyes of an orphan, Lucifer's half-smile, and Michael's contemptuous gaze from distant Heaven. He was crossing a line, not just the ocean, but also the boundary between the old world and a much more dangerous game.</p>
                <p>Los Angeles welcomed Hael with a culture shock and an overwhelming feeling. The noisy atmosphere, endless traffic, skyscrapers sparkling in the scorching California sun, are completely different from the peace of the countryside or the hustle and bustle of life, but still somewhat close to Saigon. Everything is too big, too fast, too flashy. The energy of this city is intense, complex, both vibrant and contains something chaotic, making Hael feel even more small and lost.</p>
                <p>A woman with bright red hair, dressed elegantly and wearing sunglasses that covered most of her face, waited for him at the airport with a sign that read "Hael - Morningstar Charity". She introduced herself as Evelyn, who would support him throughout her stay in LA. Evelyn's voice was sweet but somewhat mechanical, and her smile was professional but not warm. She led Hael to the waiting luxury sedan, and the car quickly merged into the heavy traffic.</p>
                <p>Hael was taken to a super-luxury hotel in Beverly Hills, where the Foundation had booked a spacious suite with sweeping views of the city. The absurd extravagance of this place once again made him feel uncomfortable. Evelyn gave him a tentative schedule: rest, a meeting with the scholarship manager tomorrow, and then a tour of the Foundation's headquarters. "Mr. Morningstar has some unexpected business right now," Evelyn announced with an old smile, "but he'll arrange a time to see you soon."</p>
                <p><strong>Heaven.</strong></p>
                <p>Gabriel and Uriel watched as Hael entered a luxury hotel in Los Angeles through a dim mist of light. "He's there," Gabriel whispered, his voice full of anxiety. "The City of the Fallen Angels, the center of Lucifer's power. Evelyn... She is one of his closest people, a soul that has been completely swallowed up by darkness." "I know," Uriel replied, his eyes still calm but deeper. "Lucifer wants to test Healiangel's limits, wants to push him between temptation and power. He wants to see if the healing essence can be bent into a tool of manipulation." "We have to do something!" Gabriel turned to Uriel, helplessness evident on his face. "Michael... He was so focused on order that he forgot compassion. He sees Healiangel as a failure, but I believe he still has the light inside!" "Patience, Gabriel," Uriel placed his hand on his brother's shoulder. "Observe. Don't underestimate the hidden power within Healiangel, even if he no longer remembers who he is. Light can glimmer in the darkest places. This lesson, however harsh, is necessary."</p>
                <p>Michael, in the Great Hall, is reviewing reports of energy drops in some of the lower heavens. He dismissed the information about Hael's arrival in LA that a subordinate angel had just reported. "Trivia of the world! Report on the defensive situation on the eastern border!" The survival of the Heavenly order was his only concern.</p>
                <p>First night in Los Angeles. Hael stood by the suite's huge glass window, looking down at the sea of light that stretched to the horizon. This city is dangerously beautiful, charming but full of pitfalls. He felt the presence of Lucifer envelop the place, an ancient, powerful and dark energy, even though he had never appeared. The initial curiosity is now tinged with obvious fear. He felt like a pawn had just been placed on the chessboard of a space game that he didn't understand the rules of the game well. Suddenly, a sharp pain flashed through his temples, and the image of a huge, brilliant but shattering pair of white wings flashed through his mind as fast as lightning, leaving behind a deep and incomprehensible sense of loss. He put his hand up to his head, trying to hold on to that image, but it was gone, leaving only the echo of the sleepless city out there.</p>

            <div class="chapter" id="chapter-11">
                 <h3>Chapter 11: The First Encounters</h3>
                 <p>After a night of flinching between luxury and insecurity, Hael is escorted by Evelyn to meet the person in charge of the scholarship program. The offices of the Morningstar Foundation occupy an entire floor in a modern glass building in the heart of Los Angeles. Minimalist yet luxurious interiors, transparent glass walls overlooking the vibrant city below, all exude power and wealth.</p>
                 <p>The person in charge is a middle-aged man named Davies, with an expensive suit and a polite smile. He greeted Hael very warmly, asking about the flight, about his first impression of Los Angeles. The conversation seemed friendly at first, but Hael sensed Davies' keen gaze analyzing him, examining every gesture and every word. "So, Hael," Davies began to get to the point, flipping through a thin file (which Hael was sure wasn't provided by you), "we're impressed with your potential. Mr. Morningstar believes he can contribute a lot to the world. Do you have any orientation about the major you want to pursue? Medicine? Social work? Areas where you can promote your special compassion?"</p>
                 <p>Compassion. From there, he touched a deep corner in Hael. He thought about the "cracks", so helpless that he couldn't ease the pain of others. A thought flashed, a vague desire to learn about the human body, about life and death, about true healing. He opened his mouth, intending to talk about medicine, about desire...</p>
                 <p>But suddenly, a thick and cold fog enveloped his mind. The thoughts that have just been formed suddenly become fragmented and meaningless. His throat was dry, and his words were choked. He stammered, trying to express himself, but only made hesitant and incoherent sounds. A sense of inferiority and confusion invades. Why do you want to study medicine? Do you have that ability? Who are you to dare to think about healing others?</p>
                 <p><strong>Heaven.</strong></p>
                 <p>Michael stood in the Great Hall, his eyes coldly looking at the dim ball of light that was displaying the scene in Davies' office. He did not directly take action, but a silent order was transmitted. A low-level angel under his rule, Raguel, the angel of justice (according to Michael's distorted interpretation), exerted an infinitesimal flow of energy, enough to amplify Hael's inferiority complex and pre-existing psychological trauma in human form, causing his mind to be confused at the decisive moment. "Justice requires the weak to recognize their place," Michael thought to himself. "It's impossible for Lucifer to easily acquire a powerful tool."</p>
                 <p>Davies frowned at Hael who was confused, his polite smile slightly faded. He made a note on the file. "Looks like you need more time to think," Davies said, his voice still professional but losing his original warmth. "It's okay. We'll discuss it in more detail later."</p>
                 <p>The tour of the Foundation's headquarters was no better. Hael walked through the rows of modern offices, looking at the well-dressed employees working with nervous expressions. Everything is artificially perfect. When he saw a report on the effectiveness of a medical assistance project in a remote area, with a keen intuition that remained, Hael recognized some conflicting figures, a flaw in the logic of resource allocation. He was about to make a suggestion, but at that moment, the building's fire alarm system suddenly howled loudly (another "accidental" incident?). In the midst of the small chaos, the idea that had just flashed in his mind disappeared as if it had never existed. When things returned to normal, he was just a quiet young Asian, seemingly a little bewildered in the smooth operation of the Foundation. He failed to express himself again.</p>
                 <p><strong>Los Angeles.</strong></p>
                 <p>Evelyn reported the situation to Lucifer via a secure video call. "He seems... unstable, sir. Intelligent, but indecisive and easily distracted. The meeting with Davies didn't go very well." Lucifer sat in Lux's shadow, smirking slightly. "Unstable? Or is someone deliberately causing interference?" He did not rule out the possibility of intervention from the "other side". "Interesting. Keep watching. That instability could make him more vulnerable, or it could be a sign of something stronger trying to emerge. This game seems to have more layers than I thought."</p>
                 <p><strong>Heaven.</strong></p>
                 <p>Gabriel saw it all through the mist of light, his heart tightened. "Michael! What was he doing? It was blatant interference! He's sabotaging Healiangel's chances!" He turned to Uriel, his voice full of indignation and helplessness. Uriel shook his head slowly. "This is not the vandalism you think, Gabriel. Michael believes he is doing justice, stopping Lucifer. And for Healiangel, this is also part of the challenge. Will he be able to overcome his self-doubt, overcome these invisible obstacles to find his own light? Or will they fall and be swallowed up by the darkness? We can only observe and hope."</p>
                 <p>Returning to the hotel room, Hael felt exhausted and humiliated. He couldn't understand himself. Why did he become so stupid and clumsy? The ideas and desires that had just flashed were quickly extinguished. It felt like there was an invisible wall that was holding him back, or perhaps, the problem was with himself—a failure, a weakness, just like Michael saw it. The throbbing pain in the temples appeared again, and this time, the image of the shattered wings seemed a little clearer, accompanied by an unquenchable sense of regret about a strength, a potential that had been stolen. He sat down on the floor, in the middle of a luxurious but cold room, a feeling of loneliness and confusion enveloped him.</p>

            <div class="chapter" id="chapter-12">
                 <h3>Chapter 12: The Mist of Doubt</h3>
                 <p>The next few days in Los Angeles passed in a tense and confusing atmosphere. Hael tried to dismiss the feeling of failure after the first meeting, telling himself it was just fatigue from the long flight and the pressure of the new environment. But the bewilderment and feeling of being stopped by some invisible wall still smoldering in my heart. He felt like a puppet, being pulled by invisible hands.</p>
                 <p>Davies and Evelyn give him a new task: to review and evaluate some applications for emergency funding from the community. "We want your perspective and empathy, Hael," Davies said with an old smile. "Help us pick out the most deserving cases."</p>
                 <p>Hael carefully read each set of records. With a keen intuition that remains, he senses the truthfulness of the account of a single mother struggling to raise her sick child, or the despair of an elderly man who lost his home after a fire. But interspersed with that were other sets of documents, elaborate sentences evoked a sense of unreality, numbers that seemed reasonable but lacked the weight of real misery. He frowned, trying to concentrate to analyze, to listen to his instincts.</p>
                 <p>But just as he began to form his judgment, the familiar cold fog came again, covering his mind. Doubts about one's own judgment arise again. Are you being too suspicious? Was the coldness and indifference he was trying to build up making him insensitive to real pain? The image of Michael and the contemptuous eyes from Heaven reappeared. That's right, you're just a failure, how can you be qualified to judge others?</p>
                 <p><strong>Heaven.</strong></p>
                 <p>Michael's order to silence is still in effect. Raguel, in the name of "justice", continues to sow seeds of doubt and low self-esteem into Hael's mind from afar, preventing him from using his angelic intuition effectively. Michael was pleased to observe Hael's embarrassment through the orb of light. "See, Healiangel," he thought to himself, "you don't belong there, and you don't belong here. Weakness will engulf you."</p>
                 <p>As a result, Hael made conflicting assessments. He offered to assist in a case that he vaguely realized later had many suspicious points, and at the same time hesitated to refuse a situation that really needed help because of the vague doubts caused by the intervention itself. Guilt and helplessness tormented him again. What are you doing? Are you helping or causing more trouble?</p>
                 <p><strong>Heaven.</strong></p>
                 <p>Gabriel couldn't take it anymore. He turned to Uriel, who was still contemplating the universe from a ruined balcony of Heaven. "Uriel, we can't let Michael and Raguel continue to do that!" Gabriel was frustrated. "That's not justice, it's damnation! They're deliberately drowning Healiangel in the mud of inferiority and failure!" Uriel turned around, his deep eyes staring directly at Gabriel. "Justice takes many forms, Gabriel. Sometimes it's cold and harsh, as Michael interprets. But he forgot that this intervention, however cruel, was also inadvertently revealing to Healiangel the existence of the invisible forces that were ruling him. It forces him to ask questions, to look for answers that go beyond the usual human logic." "But what is the price?" Gabriel almost screamed. "He'll collapse before he finds the answer!" "Or he'll find strength in that doubt," Uriel said quietly. "Sometimes, the fog is not to hide, but to test our ability to see. Even Raphael can't heal soul wounds from afar if the subject doesn't fight on his own." He mentioned the name of the Archangel of Healing, who was probably also looking helplessly down from somewhere.</p>
                 <p><strong>Los Angeles.</strong></p>
                 <p>Evelyn smiled as she received Hael's profile review. The errors in his judgment were entirely in the background, and even benefited some of Lucifer's small plans. "He's getting more and more predictable," she reported. Lucifer just shrugged his shoulders. "Just let the guys up there play their cat-and-mouse game. Chaos sometimes creates the most exciting opportunities." He was still in no hurry to meet Hael in person. Prey needs to be "broke" more closely.</p>
                 <p>Hael was lying on the big bed in the hotel room, but his eyes were wide open and he was looking up at the ceiling. The feeling of being manipulated is becoming more and more pronounced. Empty minds, wrong decisions, abnormal emotions... It can't be just a coincidence. Something or someone was deliberately hindering him. But who is it? Lucifer? Or... Some force from where he vaguely felt he belonged? The image of the broken wings reappeared, this time more painful, like a part of the body being severed. He sat up, looking at his hands. Doubts about the outside world had now begun to turn into doubts about his own being. Who are you? And why are you here, in the midst of the vortex of these invisible forces?</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chapter" id="chapter-13">
                 <h3>Chapter 13: The Shadow of the Past</h3>
                 <p>The fog was getting thicker and thicker in Hael's mind. He tried to find an explanation for the times when his mind was empty, his judgments were wrong. He went online to find out about the symptoms of temporary dementia, about anxiety disorders, but nothing really matched what he was experiencing. The feeling of being controlled and manipulated becomes obsessive. He began to doubt everything from the kindness of the people in the Morningstar Foundation to his own thoughts and feelings. The loneliness is even deeper in the luxurious but lifeless hotel room.</p>
                 <p>One afternoon, while wandering down crowded Hollywood Boulevard trying to escape the suffocation, Hael suddenly saw an elderly homeless man suddenly kneel down the side of the road, hugging his chest and breathing heavily. Everyone around hurriedly glanced by, or just stood and watched from a distance. Without a moment's hesitation, instinct rose stronger than fear, Hael rushed over. He knelt down beside the man, his hand reflexively resting on his weakly heaving chest.</p>
                 <p>A familiar flow of warmth, but this time it seemed to be stronger, purer, spreading from his palm. An extremely faint jade-green light, almost imperceptible under the bright sunlight, flashed in an instant. Hael heard the man's breathing become more regular, and his face became less pale. He opened his eyes, looking at Hael with a look of surprise and gratitude. But soon after, the familiar throbbing pain struck Hael's temple, his mind spinning, and a feeling of exhaustion hit. The memory of the last brief moment became flickering and vague. He only had time to support the man sitting against the wall before staggering to his feet, cold sweat pouring out. What did you do? What is that light?</p>
                 <p><strong>Heaven.</strong></p>
                 <p>Gabriel and Uriel both felt a faint but pure burst of energy from Hael. "He did it!" Gabriel exclaimed, a glimmer of hope flashing in his eyes. "The healing instinct is still there, stronger than Michael's intervention!" "That's right," Uriel nodded, but his expression was still not happy. "But this didn't escape Lucifer's attention either. And Michael." He looked at Raphael, who was trying to focus his healing energy toward Hael, but received only a faint response. "Raphael's energy was blocked. Michael has erected an invisible barrier around Healiangel, not only preventing help, but amplifying the negative effects." Gabriel clenched his hands. "So the hope that has just flashed is just the beginning of a bigger challenge?"</p>
                 <p>Just as Uriel had predicted, Michael felt a burst of energy. Anger flared up. "Does he dare to resist?" He orders Raguel to strengthen "justice", focusing on sowing fear and skepticism in Hael's mind after every sign of strength rising.</p>
                 <p><strong>Los Angeles.</strong></p>
                 <p>That night, Hael received a call from Evelyn. "Mr. Morningstar has returned to Los Angeles and wants to see you tonight. The bus will pick you up at 8 o'clock." Her voice was still even, but Hael felt an unusual urgency.</p>
                 <p>The luxury car takes Hael to another skyscraper, where the famous nightclub Lux is located on the top floor. Different from the flashy but somewhat artificial look of charity events, Lux has a ghostly charm, full of temptation. The lights were dim, the music was melodious but enchanting, and beautiful people passed each other in silence. Evelyn led Hael into a private elevator and went straight to Lucifer's penthouse above the club.</p>
                 <p>Lucifer Morningstar was standing by the giant glass window, looking down at the glittering night city, holding an amber wine glass in his hand. He turned around when Hael walked in, smiling familiarly but this time it seemed to have more depth, more mystery. "Hi Hael," he said, his voice echoing throughout the lavish room. "It's nice to finally see you here again, in my 'yard'." Hael stood still, trying to stay calm in the face of the overwhelming temperament of the man in front of her. "I heard that you have had some experiences... interesting in Los Angeles," Lucifer continued, stepping closer, his black eyes swirling deep into Hael. "Sudden headaches? Moments of disorientation? Or the feeling of a special ability that you can't control?" Hael was stunned. How did he know? "Don't be surprised," Lucifer laughed slightly. "I know more than you think. I know you're not like ordinary people. You're special, Hael. Very special." He stopped, looking directly into Hael's eyes. "And I can help you understand yourself. Help him control that gift, instead of being afraid of it. Help you find what you lost." The offer was like a thunderbolt in Hael's ears. Know yourself? Control the gift? Find what you lost? That's exactly what he longs for and fears. Lucifer was holding out the key that opened the mysterious door to his past, but he knew that this key was in the hands of the Devil. "Why?" Hael asked softly, his voice trembling. "Why do you want to help me?" Lucifer shrugged, a half-smile full of implications. "Because I like interesting things. And you, Healiangel... well no, Hael, you're one of the most interesting things that have fallen into this dull world. Moreover," he leaned forward, lowering his voice, "maybe we have some kind of enemy in common who is deliberately blocking your way."</p>
                 <p>Hael stood silent, his mind confused. Lucifer's offer was tempting, promising the answers he desperately sought. But instinct tells him that this is a sweet trap, a path to darkness. What choice do you have to make? Believing in the Devil to find himself, or continuing to grope in the mist of doubt or, alone against invisible forces?</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chapter" id="chapter-14">
                 <h3>Chapter 14: The Devil's Offer</h3>
                 <p>Hael stood like heaven in the middle of a lavish penthouse, his mind beeped by Lucifer's last words. Healiangel. That name echoed in his mind, strange but vaguely familiar, like touching an old wound that had not healed. Lucifer knew. He knew he was not normal, he knew about strange abilities, about the chaos inside him. And he offered to help, offered to give him the truth, the control. An offer came from the Lord of Hell.</p>
                 <p>"You... What do you know about me?" Hael stammered, trying to keep his voice calm even though his heart was beating wildly. The instinctive fear of the entity in front of him struggles violently with a burning desire to know who he is.</p>
                 <p>Lucifer smiled, a smile that was frighteningly understanding. "I know you're lost, Hael. I know you feel a great power inside but you are afraid of it, because you don't understand, you can't control it. I know you feel watched, hindered by forces that don't want you to find yourself." He walked over slowly, pouring more wine into the glass. "There are people who love order to the point of blindness, they are afraid of freedom, they are afraid of unpredictable potential. They wanted him to forever be a weak, controllable person, instead of becoming... your true self."</p>
                 <p>Lucifer's words were like needles piercing Hael's deepest suspicions. The feeling of being obstructed, the times when the mind is empty for no reason... Was it not his own weakness, but external interference? From the "orderly ones" that Lucifer was referring to? The image of Michael and the cold Heaven appeared.</p>
                 <p>"Which enemy?" Hael asked, his voice hoarse.</p>
                 <p>"Oh, you'll notice soon," Lucifer shrugged, holding his wine glass to his lips. "When you start asking the right questions. When he stopped being afraid of his power and began to seek to master it. I don't ask you to believe me right away. I have only one choice: to continue to live in the fog of fear and doubt, to be guided by those who claim to be righteous, or to step into the light—though that light may come from a place that the world calls darkness—to find your own truth and freedom."</p>
                 <p>He put down his wine glass and approached Hael, only a few steps away. The energy from him radiated intensely, both seductive and dangerous. "I can teach you how to control that energy, Hael. Teach him how to use it without exhaustion, without losing his memory. Teach him how to see through the falsehood of this world. All he needed to do was... trust."</p>
                 <p>The moment Lucifer said the word "trust", a chill suddenly ran down Hael's spine. A feeling of disgust, a red alarm sounded in his subconscious, causing him to involuntarily take a step back.</p>
                 <p><strong>Heaven.</strong></p>
                 <p>Raguel, on Michael's urgent orders, stepped up his impact. The flow of intervening energy was no longer just a distraction, but a direct activation of the instinctive fear, the last defense of the Hael soul against the primordial darkness. Michael observed, pleased to see Hael step back. "That's right, be afraid of him. That fear will keep you away from the abyss."</p>
                 <p>But Gabriel was horrified. "Do you see, Uriel?" He pointed to the orb of light, his voice trembling with anger and fear. "Michael is pushing Healiangel into Lucifer's hands! That interference only made Lucifer's words about the 'enemy in the way' even more believable! We're turning ourselves into villains in his eyes!" Uriel was silent for a long time, his complicated gaze looking at the image of Hael trembling in front of Lucifer. "Perhaps, Gabriel. Or perhaps... This is the crux of the test. Would Healiangel be wise enough to recognize the true nature behind that sweet offer, despite interference from both sides? Freedom of choice, even in the most extreme circumstances, is the ultimate power."</p>
                 <p><strong>Los Angeles.</strong></p>
                 <p>Lucifer sensed the interference from afar, as well as the intense struggle within Hael. He was not angry at all, on the contrary, he felt even more excited. He stepped back, keeping a safe distance, and his smile still didn't go out. "There's no need to make a decision right away," he said softly, his voice full of fake sympathy. "I know this is a difficult decision. Think twice, Hael. The door of this penthouse is always open to welcome you, whenever you are ready for the truth." He motioned to Evelyn, who was already waiting at the door. "Evelyn will take you back to the hotel."</p>
                 <p>Hael left Lux as a lost soul. His mind was spinning with Lucifer's words, with the feeling of fear and disgust just now, and also a faint glimmer of hope about finding himself. Who is telling the truth? Who is cheating? Who is the real enemy? Is Heaven cold, or is the Devil charming? He looked up at the night sky of Los Angeles, feeling more alone and small than ever, trapped between two giants, and most terrifyingly, he no longer knew what to believe, not even himself.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chapter" id="chapter-15">
                 <h3>Chapter 15: Echoes from Heaven</h3>
                 <p>Hael returned to the hotel, but his mind was no longer in the lavish suite. Lucifer's words, especially the name Healiangel, echoed forever. He said that there was an enemy who was hindering him. He said that there were people who blindly liked order and wanted him to be weak forever. The image of Michael and the cold Heaven appeared, which matched that allusion in a terrifying way. The feeling of betrayal, abandoned by the very place where he vaguely felt belonged, began to rekindle, intertwined with the inherent fear and doubt for Lucifer.</p>
                 <p>Unable to sit still, Hael decided to experiment. He needed to know if the feeling of being stopped was real or if it was just his imagination. That night, in a quiet hotel room, he sat flat on the floor, closed his eyes, trying to concentrate intensely. He recalled the warmth that spread when he touched the homeless man, trying to recreate that energy. He visualized the jade-green light, trying to name it in his mind: Healiangel.</p>
                 <p>Immediately, a sharp pain throbbed in his head, more intense than before. It felt like an invisible hand was squeezing his mind, preventing all efforts to concentrate. Chaotic and shattered images flashed: shattered wings, screams, a black abyss... and then everything went dark. Hael gasped, cold sweat drenched the back of his shirt. There is no doubt about it. There was a certain force that was actively stopping him, punishing him every time he tried to touch his true self. What Lucifer said was true?</p>
                 <p><strong>Heaven.</strong></p>
                 <p>Gabriel went to the garden where Raphael used to sit quietly. The once brilliant garden is now as faded as Heaven itself. "Raphael," Gabriel called softly. "I feel Healiangel's pain. He's trying... but was blocked by Michael's wall. What can you do?" Raphael, the healing angel with deeply sad eyes, shook his head. "I tried, Gabriel. My healing energy couldn't penetrate the barrier that Michael and Raguel had erected around his soul. Not only do they prevent help from us, but they amplify his fear and hurt inside. It pains my heart to see a healer again deprived of his or her abilities and suffer like that."</p>
                 <p>In another hallway, Chamuel, the angel of peace, is trying to talk to Michael. "Your severity is necessary, Governor-General, but will interfering with Healiangel's journey really bring order? Or just push him into the arms of the Fallen?" Michael turned around, his eyes as cold as ice. "Peace comes only from absolute strength and discipline, Chamuel. The weak must be eliminated or realize their mistakes. I can't let Lucifer take advantage of Healiangel. My actions are necessary to protect Heaven!" He turned away, not wanting to hear more. Michael summoned the celestial commanders, and his voice echoed throughout the Great Hall: "Strengthen discipline! Any expression of sympathy for those who have fallen will be considered rebellion!"</p>
                 <p><strong>Los Angeles.</strong></p>
                 <p>In Lux's penthouse, Lucifer was playing a game of chess alone, the black and white pieces moving at his will. Mazikeen, a loyal female warrior with black hair and sharp eyes, stood next to the report. "Hael seems to be very confused after last night's meeting. He was trying to use energy... and failed miserably. It seems like his 'old friends' over there are doing a great job pushing him towards us." Lucifer smiled slightly, moving the Black Queen. "Very good. Let Michael do the hard work for me. The stronger the repression, the more the desire for freedom burns. Hael will soon realize who really wants to 'help' him." He looked at Mazikeen. "But don't be negligent. I feel that the inherent purity within him is still very strong. Prepare for the next stage. It's time to give him a taste of some real power."</p>
                 <p>Back in the hotel room, after a severe headache, Hael fell asleep in exhaustion. And in the dream, a clearer image than any previous memory appeared. He found himself standing in a garden filled with soft light, not the harsh sunlight, but a warm, pure light. In front of him was an angel with brilliant golden wings, a sad face but a worried gaze, saying something to him. He couldn't hear the words clearly, but he felt sincere concern. It was Gabriel. Then the image faded, replaced by another angel with a gentle smile, eyes shining with wisdom and healing – Raphael? The image flashed before he could see more clearly.</p>
                 <p>Hael woke up, his heart pounding. That dream... that feeling... too honest. It was different from the cold, hostile he felt from the invisible intervention. Is it... didn't all Heaven want to harm you? Are there people who still care about you?</p>
                 <p>What is the truth? He was caught between Lucifer's tempting offer and conflicting echoes from Heaven. He couldn't believe Lucifer, but he also couldn't believe in a Heaven that seemed to be deliberately drowning him. He realized that if he wanted to find answers, he couldn't just sit back and wait or be afraid. He had to act on his own, search for himself, no matter how dangerous that path was. Perhaps, it's time to probe Evelyn and Davies more closely.</p>
                 <p>Vivid parallel memories flooded into his mind like a waterfall:</p>
                 <p>He was standing in the middle of the glorious Great Hall of Light, in front of him was the brilliant Golden Throne.</p>
                 <p>His own white, huge, and powerful wings were spreading.</p>
                 <p>Gabriel's worried face said, "Healiangel, don't do that! It's very dangerous!"</p>
                 <p>Raphael's gentle smile: "Compassion is your greatest strength, remember."</p>
                 <p>And then, the image of the Curtain cracking, he rushed towards it, the blue light enveloping it all...</p>
                 <p>"Aaaa!" Hael screamed and then fell to the floor, hugging his head. The light went out. The intense pain and exhaustion made him almost faint. But in his mind, the images just now were still clear. Wings. The name Healiangel. Gabriel. Raphael. Heaven. That's the truth. He wasn't Hael. You are Healiangel. An angel.</p>
                 <p>The office door opened. Evelyn and Davies rushed in, their faces panicked when they saw Hael lying on the floor, the computer screen still flickering. They looked at each other, then at Hael with complicated eyes, both worried and wary.</p>
                 <p><strong>Heaven.</strong></p>
                 <p>Hael's sudden burst of energy creates a ripple that spreads all the way to Heaven. Michael roared angrily, the incident was completely out of his control. Raguel trembled in fear. Gabriel and Raphael felt their brother's awakening, and hope and anxiety surged at the same time. Uriel only sighed quietly, knowing that the space chess game had just taken an unforeseen turn.</p>
                 <p><strong>Los Angeles.</strong></p>
                 <p>Lucifer was toasting with a business partner when he received an urgent message from Evelyn. He glanced at it, then smiled, a smile full of excitement and danger. "Apparently, Michael just gave me a surprise gift. Healiangel partially recalled. Very good. It's time for me to officially take action."</p>
                 <p>Hael was escorted to the hotel by Evelyn and Davies in a semi-conscious state. He lay on the bed, his eyes closed, but his mind was constantly spinning with the pieces of memories he had just recovered. You are Healiangel. But why are you here? Why lose wings and power? Why would Heaven want to hinder you? Lucifer's words about the enemy rang out again. But the image of Gabriel and Raphael in memory brings a feeling of warmth and trust. He was trapped, not only between Heaven and Hell, but also between the glorious past and the miserable mortal present. He knew he had just touched the truth, but that truth opened up a multitude of new questions and dangers.</p>

                <h3>Chapter 16: Journey in the Darkness</h3>
                <p>Hael and Gabriel ran through the frigid Alaskan forest, Hael's emerald green light guiding their way, illuminating the snow-covered paths. Though his body was still weak after the battle with the shadow creatures, Hael's spirit was stronger than ever. He felt a new sense of freedom – no longer bound by Michael or Lucifer, he could decide his own path.</p>
                <p><strong>A Temporary Shelter.</strong></p>
                <p>After hours of fleeing, Gabriel led Hael to a small cave hidden deep in the mountains. The cave was covered by frozen vines, almost invisible from the outside. Inside, the air was cold but dry, and Gabriel quickly started a small fire for warmth.</p>
                <p>Hael sat down by the fire, panting. He looked at Gabriel, his eyes filled with determination but also a hint of worry. <em>“Mr. Gabriel, where do we go next? I... I don’t know where to start looking for the other fallen angels.”</em></p>
                <p>Gabriel smiled, placing a hand on Hael's shoulder. <em>“We will find them, Hael. I can sense the energy of fallen angels, even if their memories and powers have been stripped away. But first, you need to rest and recover. Michael and Lucifer won’t stop – they will continue to hunt us.”</em></p>
                <p>Hael nodded, but a big question remained unanswered in his heart: how could he help the other fallen angels when he himself was still struggling to understand who he was? He looked into the fire, feeling the emerald green light within his body flickering efeitosly, as if waiting for something.</p>
                <p><strong>A New Memory Surfaces.</strong></p>
                <p>That night, as Hael drifted off to sleep, a new dream appeared. He saw himself standing in a field of vibrant flowers, similar to his previous dream, but this time, the figure of an angel with soft white wings was clearer. The angel had emerald green eyes identical to his, and her voice was as gentle as music.</p>
                <p><em>“Hael, my brother,”</em> the angel said, her voice full of love. <em>“I am Seraphina, your sister. We used to heal souls together in Heaven, before everything collapsed. You have forgotten me, but I have never forgotten you.”</em></p>
                <p>Hael was stunned, emotions surging within him. He didn't remember Seraphina, but her voice made his heart ache, as if a buried part of his memory was trying to resurface. <em>“Seraphina... where are you? How can I find you?”</em> he asked, his voice trembling.</p>
                <p>Seraphina smiled QuantityOnHandly. <em>“I am far away, Hael. But you will find me – and the others – if you continue to believe in your heart. Your power is not just to heal bodies, but also to heal memories. Use it, and you will find us.”</em></p>
                <p>Hael woke with a start, sweat beading on his forehead. He looked at Gabriel, who was keeping watch at the cave entrance. <em>“Mr. Gabriel, I just dreamt of an angel – she said she was my sister, named Seraphina. She said I could heal memories... do you know her?”</em></p>
                <p>Gabriel nodded, his eyes glinting with emotion. <em>“Seraphina... yes. She is your sister, Hael. You two were once the most powerful healing angel duo in Heaven. She was also exiled, around the same time as you, but I don’t know where she is. If you dreamt of her, perhaps it’s a sign that you are beginning to regain your memories – and your true power.”</em></p>
                <p>Hael fell silent, thinking. He felt a new ray of hope – if he could heal memories, he could not only find Seraphina and the other fallen angels, but also help them remember themselves, help them escape the pain of oblivion.</p>
                <p><strong>Michael And Lucifer Take Action.</strong></p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Michael and Lucifer wasted no time in tracking Hael and Gabriel. Lucifer used his network of spies – humans and fallen angels working for Lux Foundation – to follow Hael's energy. Michael, with his power, could sense the energy fluctuations from the emerald green light, 카메라ugh very faint.</p>
                <p>They decided to split up: Lucifer led a team to northern Alaska, while Michael headed east. Lucifer, with his cunning nature, began to spread rumors among the fallen angel communities that Hael was a danger – an out-of-control angel who could destroy everything. He hoped this would turn other fallen angels against Hael, forcing him to seek Lucifer for protection.</p>
                <p>Michael, on the other hand, cared little for schemes. He just wanted to destroy Hael once and for all. <em>“If he cannot be controlled, he must be destroyed,”</em> Michael muttered, the golden sword in his hand glowing with a cold light.</p>
                <p><strong>A New Decision.</strong></p>
                <p>Hael and Gabriel left the cave the next morning, continuing their journey. Based on the dream, Hael felt a strong urge leading him south – the direction he believed Seraphina was waiting. He told Gabriel: <em>“I want to find Seraphina. If she’s right, I can heal memories – not just for myself, but for all the other fallen angels. I want them to remember who they are, and build a new world with me.”</em></p>
                <p>Gabriel nodded, his eyes full of pride. <em>“I will go with you, Hael. No matter how difficult the path ahead, we will overcome it together.”</em></p>
                <p>They began their journey south, unaware that Michael and Lucifer were drawing closer, and that greater challenges awaited them.</p>

                <h3>Chapter 17: Meeting the First One</h3>
                <p>Hael and Gabriel walked through the frozen lands of Alaska, heading south. After many days of travel, they reached a small town nestled among snow-covered hills. The town was deserted, with only a few scattered wooden houses and a small bar being the only place with lights conceitos.</p>
                <p><strong>A Fallen Angel.</strong></p>
                <p>When Hael and Gabriel entered the bar, the atmosphere inside was strangely quiet. The locals looked at them with curious eyes, but no one said anything. Hael sensed a faint but familiar energy – the energy of a fallen angel.</p>
                <p>In the corner of the bar, a young woman sat alone, holding a glass of liquor. She had fiery red hair, dull gray eyes, and a long scar running down her left cheek. Hael looked at her, feeling the emerald green light in his body tremble slightly – a sign that she was indeed a fallen angel.</p>
                <p>Hael approached, his voice gentle: <em>“Hello. I’m Hael. I… I think I know you, though I don’t remember clearly. Do you feel something… familiar?”</em></p>
                <p>The woman looked up, her eyes full of suspicion. <em>“I don’t know you,”</em> she said, her voice cold. <em>“I’m Asha. I’ve lived here my whole life. You’re mistaken.”</em></p>
                <p>But Hael didn’t give up. He sat down opposite her, his gaze sincere. <em>“Asha, I know you don’t remember me. I didn’t remember who I was either, until recently. But I can help you – I can help you remember. You are an angel, like me.”</em></p>
                <p>Asha scoffed, but a flicker of doubt appeared in her eyes. <em>“Angel? You’re crazy. I’m just an ordinary person, living an ordinary life. I don’t need your help.”</em></p>
                <p>Gabriel, standing behind Hael, spoke: <em>“Asha, I know you. You were once Ashael, an angel of light and fire. You were exiled at the same time as Hael, because you opposed Michael’s order. You don’t remember, but your memory is still there, waiting to be awakened.”</em></p>
                <p>Asha fell silent, her gaze wavering. She didn’t want to believe, but something in Gabriel’s voice unsettled her – as if a deep part of her soul was trying to awaken.</p>
                <p><strong>Healing Memories.</strong></p>
                <p>Hael raised his hand, emerald green light flaring from his palm. <em>“Asha, let me help you,”</em> he said. <em>“I can heal your memories. You will remember who you are – and you will no longer feel lost.”</em></p>
                <p>Asha hesitated, but finally, she nodded. Hael placed his hand on her forehead, and the green light flowed into her body, gentle yet powerful. Asha closed her eyes, and images from the past began to return – images of Heaven, of the brilliant fire she once controlled, and of Hael, the brother she once fought alongside.</p>
                <p>When the green light faded, Asha opened her eyes, tears streaming down her cheeks. <em>“Hael… brother,”</em> she whispered, her voice choked with emotion. <em>“I remember. I remember everything. I am Ashael… I was once an angel.”</em></p>
                <p>Hael smiled, but he also felt a slight pain in his chest – the price of healing memories. He knew that every time he used this power, he lost a part of himself, but he didn’t regret it. He had helped Asha remember who she was, and that was the most important thing.</p>
                <p>Asha hugged Hael QuantityOnHandly, sobbing. <em>“Thank you, Hael. I’ve lived in darkness for too long… I forgot who I was. But now I remember – and I want to help you. I want to find the others with you.”</em></p>
                <p>Gabriel smiled, his eyes shining with hope. <em>“We’ve just found our first ally, Hael. Ashael will be an important part of our journey.”</em></p>
                <p><strong>A New Threat.</strong></p>
                <p>But their joy was short-lived. That night, as Hael, Gabriel, and Asha were preparing to leave town, a group of strangers appeared, surrounding the bar. They were Lucifer's men, sent to capture Hael. Leading the group was a tall man, with cold eyes and a black sword in his hand.</p>
                <p><em>“Hael, I know you’re here,”</em> the man said, his voice low. <em>“Lord Lucifer sends a message: come back, or we will destroy everyone who shelters you.”</em></p>
                <p>Hael clenched his fists, emerald green light flaring around him. <em>“I will not go back,”</em> he said, his voice firm. <em>“If you want to fight, I will fight.”</em></p>
                <p>Asha stepped forward, fiery red flames erupting from her hands. <em>“I will fight too,”</em> she said, her eyes blazing. <em>“No one harms my brother.”</em></p>
                <p>Gabriel raised his hand, a stream of white light appearing, ready to protect them both. A new battle was about to begin, and this time, Hael was no longer fighting alone.</p>
           </div>
     
           <div id="chapter-18" class="chapter">
                <h3>Chapter 18: Fire and Light</h3>
                <p>The air in the small town suddenly grew tense as Hael, Gabriel, and Asha faced Lucifer's group. The man leading them, who called himself Kain, smiled coldly, his black sword palavras in the dim light of the bar.</p>
                <p><strong>A Fierce Battle.</strong></p>
                <p>Kain ordered the attack, and his men rushed forward. Hael raised his hand, emerald green light erupting, forming a shield protecting all three of them. Asha, with her memories and powers restored, summoned brilliant red flames, launching fireballs at the enemy. Gabriel used his white light, attacking with the precision and power of an Archangel.</p>
                <p>But Kain's group was not weak. They were humans manipulated by Lucifer, granted dark powers to fight against angels. Kain, with his black sword, easily pierced Hael's shield, forcing him to retreat. A shallow cut appeared on Hael's arm, blood flowing, but he didn't let it deter him.</p>
                <p>Asha screamed, her fire burning more fiercely, incinerating some of the enemies. <em>“Hael, be careful!”</em> she shouted, rushing to shield him. But Kain was faster, his sword slashing towards Asha, and she barely managed to raise her arm to block. Her fire erupted protectively, but she was still pushed back, falling to the ground.</p>
                <p>Gabriel, seeing Asha injured, furiously charged at Kain. His white light flared, forming a sword of light, and the two clashed QuantityOnHandly. Hael ran to Asha's side, placing his hand on her wound. Emerald green light flowed into her body, healing the injury, but Hael felt a familiar pain in his chest – the price of using his power.</p>
                <p><em>“I’m fine, Hael,”</em> Asha said, her voice weak but firm. <em>“Don’t worry about me. Help Mr. Gabriel.”</em></p>
                <p>Hael nodded, standing up. He watched Gabriel and Kain fighting, and he realized he couldn't just stand by. He raised his hand, the green light flaring stronger than ever, not to heal, but to attack. A beam of green light shot out, hitting Kain and sending him efeitosling.</p>
                <p>Kain panted, his eyes filled with hatred. <em>“You... you will regret this, Hael. Lord Lucifer will not spare you.”</em> He and his group quickly retreated, leaving Hael, Gabriel, and Asha exhausted but victorious.</p>
                <p><strong>A New Ally.</strong></p>
                <p>After the battle, the townspeople, who had witnessed everything, emerged from their hiding places. An old man, the owner of the bar, approached Hael, his eyes full of respect. <em>“You... you are an angel, aren't you?”</em> he asked. <em>“You protected us. We owe you our lives.”</em></p>
                <p>Hael smiled efeitosly. <em>“I’m not the angel you think I am. I’m just... someone who wants to help. Thank you for not running away.”</em></p>
                <p>The old man nodded, then turned to the others. <em>“We must help them. If those men return, we will fight with them.”</em> The townspeople voiced their support in unison, and Hael felt a warmth spread through him – for the first time, he felt he had not only Gabriel and Asha, but also ordinary humans willing to stand by him.</p>
                <p><strong>Michael Draws Closer.</strong></p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Michael, who was tracking Hael in eastern Alaska, sensed the energy fluctuations from the battle. He stopped, his eyes blazing with anger. <em>“He’s nearby,”</em> he muttered. <em>“I will find him, and this time, I will end it all.”</em></p>
                <p>Michael summoned a team of angels from Heaven, warriors loyal to him, and began to advance towards the small town. He didn't care what Lucifer had done – he only wanted to destroy Hael, to protect the order he had built in Heaven.</p>
                <p><strong>Lucifer And a New Plan.</strong></p>
                <p>In Los Angeles, Lucifer received Kain's report. He wasn't angry; on the contrary, his smile grew more dangerous. <em>“Hael is growing stronger,”</em> he said to his assistant. <em>“But he’s still naive. He thinks compassion can save everyone. I will show him that this world doesn’t work that way.”</em></p>
                <p>Lucifer ordered Kain to assemble a larger army – not just humans, but also other fallen angels he had manipulated. He decided to meet Hael personally, but this time, he wouldn't use force. He would use Hael's own compassion to trap him.</p>
                <p><strong>A Prophetic Dream.</strong></p>
                <p>That night, Hael dreamt of Seraphina again. But this time, the dream was no longer gentle. He saw Seraphina imprisoned in a cage of dark light, her face filled with pain. <em>“Hael, be careful,”</em> she whispered. <em>“Lucifer is coming. He will use me to trap you. Don’t let your compassion become your weakness.”</em></p>
                <p>Hael woke with a start, his heart pounding. He told Gabriel and Asha about the dream, and all three realized they were facing a greater danger than ever before. Lucifer didn't just want to capture Hael – he wanted to destroy him from within.</p>
                <p><strong>Preparing for the Fight.</strong></p>
                <p>Hael, Gabriel, and Asha decided to stay in town for a while longer, training the townspeople to prepare for the upcoming battle. Hael began to use his power to heal the townspeople's spiritual wounds – the pain of loss, poverty, and fear. Each time he did so, he felt himself grow stronger, as if his compassion was nurturing his own power.</p>
                <p>Asha, with her fire, taught the townspeople how to fight and protect themselves. Gabriel, with his experience, planned the town's defenses. They knew that Michael and Lucifer would soon find them, and this time, they would not run. They would fight – not just for themselves, but for all those they wanted to protect.</p>

                <h3>Chapter 19: Lucifer's Trap</h3>
                <p>Hael, Gabriel, and Asha continued to train the townspeople, preparing for the battle they knew was coming. Hael spent a lot of time healing the spiritual wounds of the people – the pain of loss, fear, and loneliness. Each time he did so, his emerald green light grew stronger, as if his compassion was nurturing his inner strength.</p>
                <p><strong>Lucifer's Arrival.</strong></p>
                <p>One cold morning, Lucifer appeared in town, but this time, he brought no army. He came alone, in his perfect black suit, with a charming yet cold smile. He walked into the center of town, raising his hands as a sign of peace, but no one in town trusted him.</p>
                <p>Hael, Gabriel, and Asha stepped out to face Lucifer. Hael clenched his fists, his emerald green light ready to erupt. <em>“What do you want, Lucifer?”</em> he asked, his voice firm but wary.</p>
                <p>Lucifer smiled, his eyes glinting with amusement. <em>“Hael, I didn’t come to fight. I came to make an offer – an offer I believe you won’t be able to refuse.”</em></p>
                <p>Gabriel stepped forward, shielding Hael. <em>“Don’t listen to him, Hael. He’s a liar. He never means well.”</em></p>
                <p>Lucifer shrugged, feigning hurt. <em>“Gabriel, I’m truly disappointed by your suspicion. But I’m not talking to you. I’m talking to Hael.”</em> He turned to Hael, his voice low and persuasive. <em>“Hael, I know you’re looking for Seraphina – your sister. I know where she is. And I can take you to her.”</em></p>
                <p>Hael was stunned, his heart pounding. He remembered his dream – the image of Seraphina imprisoned in a cage of dark light, her face full of pain. <em>“You… you’re lying,”</em> he said, but his voice wavered. <em>“How do you know about Seraphina?”</em></p>
                <p>Lucifer raised his hand, and a faint image appeared – an image of Seraphina, trapped in a cage of black light, just as in Hael’s dream. <em>“I’m not lying, Hael,”</em> Lucifer said. <em>“She is being held captive by a force that even I cannot completely control. But I can help you save her – if you agree to come with me.”</em></p>
                <p>Asha grabbed Hael’s hand, her eyes filled with worry. <em>“Hael, don’t trust him! This is a trap!”</em></p>
                <p>Hael fell silent, thinking. He knew Lucifer was untrustworthy, but he couldn’t ignore the chance to save Seraphina. He turned to Gabriel, his eyes full of anguish. <em>“Mr. Gabriel, what should I do? I can’t let Seraphina suffer… but I also can’t let Lucifer control me.”</em></p>
                <p>Gabriel sighed, placing a hand on Hael’s shoulder. <em>“Hael, I understand how you feel. But if you go with Lucifer, you’ll fall into his hands. We can find Seraphina another way – I promise.”</em></p>
                <p>Lucifer laughed QuantityOnHandly, his voice laced with sarcasm. <em>“Find another way? Gabriel, you know that no one but me can lead him to Seraphina. And time is running out, Hael. She’s growing weaker every day. If you don’t act, you’ll lose her forever.”</em></p>
                <p><strong>A Painful Decision.</strong></p>
                <p>Hael lowered his head, an intense internal struggle raging within him. He didn’t want to trust Lucifer, but the image of Seraphina in agony made his heart clench. Finally, he looked up, his eyes resolute. <em>“Alright, Lucifer. I’ll go with you. But if you deceive me, I swear I will destroy you – no matter the cost.”</em></p>
                <p>Gabriel and Asha tried to stop him, but Hael raised his hand, his emerald green light flaring gently, like a word of comfort. <em>“Mr. Gabriel, Asha, I have to do this. But I’m not going alone. I want you two to come with me. I trust you – and I need you by my side.”</em></p>
                <p>Lucifer shrugged, smiling. <em>“As you wish, Hael. But remember, I don’t like being threatened. Let’s go – we don’t have much time.”</em></p>
                <p>Hael, Gabriel, and Asha followed Lucifer, leaving the town. The townspeople watched them go, their eyes full of worry but also hope. They knew Hael was embarking on a dangerous journey, but they also believed he would return.</p>
                <p><strong>Michael Arrives.</strong></p>
                <p>Only a few hours after Hael left, Michael and his angelic host arrived in town. He saw traces of emerald green energy, and he knew Hael had just been there. The townspeople, though frightened, revealed nothing about Hael, but Michael didn’t need their words. He sensed Hael's direction, and he ordered his team to continue the pursuit.</p>
                <p><em>“Hael will not escape me,”</em> Michael roared, his golden sword blazing in his hand. <em>“I will destroy him – and Lucifer too, if necessary.”</em></p>
                <p>Michael didn’t know that Hael and Lucifer were heading in the same direction – and a confrontation between the three powers was about to become inevitable.</p>

                <h3>Chapter 20: Journey to the Shadowlands</h3>
                <p>Lucifer led Hael, Gabriel, and Asha to a private airfield on the outskirts of Alaska, where a plane was waiting. They flew south, across the ocean, and landed in a desolate region of South America, where dense rainforests and treacherous mountains covered the land.</p>
                <p><strong>The Shadowlands.</strong></p>
                <p>Lucifer took them to an ancient temple deep in the jungle, surrounded by strange black smoke. The temple looked like it had been abandoned for centuries, with moss-covered stone walls and crumbling statues. Hael sensed a powerful dark energy emanating from within – an energy identical to the shadow creatures he had faced before.</p>
                <p><em>“Seraphina is in there,”</em> Lucifer said, pointing to the temple entrance. <em>“But I warn you, Hael – this place not only contains her, but also an ancient power, stronger than any angel we have ever faced. If you want to save her, you will have to face it.”</em></p>
                <p>Hael nodded, his eyes resolute. <em>“I don’t care. I will save Seraphina – no matter what I have to face.”</em></p>
                <p>Gabriel grabbed Hael’s hand, his eyes filled with worry. <em>“Hael, I will go with you. But be careful – I don’t trust Lucifer. He might be using you.”</em></p>
                <p>Asha also nodded, fiery red flames erupting from her hands. <em>“I’ll go too. We’re a team, Hael.”</em></p>
                <p>Lucifer stood outside, smiling mysteriously. <em>“I’ll wait here. Good luck.”</em></p>
                <p><strong>Facing the Darkness.</strong></p>
                <p>Hael, Gabriel, and Asha entered the temple; the air inside was cold and heavy. Dark stone corridors led them to a large chamber in the center, where a cage of black light imprisoned Seraphina. She lay motionless inside, her soft white wings chained, her face pale and pained.</p>
                <p>Hael shouted: <em>“Seraphina!”</em> He rushed forward, but before he could touch the cage, a colossal figure emerged from the shadows. It was an ancient entity, shaped like a giant serpent, but its body was made of darkness and black smoke. Its eyes blazed like two red flames, and its voice echoed like thunder.</p>
                <p><em>“Who dares trespass upon my domain?”</em> the entity roared. <em>“I am Abyssal, guardian of eternal darkness. You will never leave this place!”</em></p>
                <p>Asha summoned her fire, attacking Abyssal, but her flames were swallowed by the darkness. Gabriel raised his hand, his white light flaring, but Abyssal easily pushed him back, sending him to the ground. Hael stepped forward, emerald green light erupting from his body, forming a shield protecting all three of them.</p>
                <p><em>“I didn’t come to fight you,”</em> Hael said, his voice firm. <em>“I came to save my sister. Release her, and we will leave.”</em></p>
                <p>Abyssal laughed QuantityOnHandly, its voice laced with sarcasm. <em>“You think you can command me? Your power is nothing compared to eternal darkness! But I will give you a chance – if you can pass my test, I will release her.”</em></p>
                <p><strong>Abyssal's Challenge.</strong></p>
                <p>Abyssal raised a shadowy arm, and a portal of black light appeared. <em>“Step in here, and face your greatest fear,”</em> it said. <em>“If you overcome it, she will be free. If not, you will be imprisoned forever in darkness.”</em></p>
                <p>Hael looked at Gabriel and Asha, his eyes glinting with determination. <em>“I will do this. You two stay here and protect Seraphina.”</em></p>
                <p>Gabriel tried to stop him, but Hael had already stepped through the portal before he could say anything. The portal closed behind him, leaving Gabriel and Asha to face Abyssal, not knowing what would happen to Hael.</p>
                <p><strong>The Greatest Fear.</strong></p>
                <p>Inside the portal, Hael found himself in an empty space, where darkness enveloped everything. Before him, an image appeared – an image of himself, but with pitch-black eyes and a malevolent smile. It was the dark version of Hael – the manifestation of his greatest fear: becoming a destroyer, losing his compassion, and becoming an instrument of darkness.</p>
                <p><em>“You can’t run from me, Hael,”</em> the dark version said, its voice full of sarcasm. <em>“I am a part of you – the part you always try to deny. You think compassion can save everyone? You’re wrong. This world only worships power, and I am your true power.”</em></p>
                <p>Hael recoiled, his heart pounding. He knew this dark version wasn't real, but its words touched a deep fear within him. He feared that one day, he would lose himself, become the thing he always dreaded.</p>
                <p>But then, he remembered Gabriel’s words: <em>“Your strength lies in your heart.”</em> He remembered the people he had saved – little Hoa, the old man at the hotel, the children in the storm, and even Asha. He remembered why he fought – not for power, but for compassion.</p>
                <p>Hael stepped forward, emerald green light erupting from his body, stronger than ever. <em>“You are not me,”</em> he said, his voice firm. <em>“I am Healiangel, and I choose my own path. I will never become you!”</em></p>
                <p>The green light enveloped the dark version, purifying it completely. The empty space vanished, and Hael found himself back in the temple chamber. The portal of black light was gone, and Seraphina’s cage had opened.</p>
                <p>Abyssal, though displeased, roared: <em>“You have passed the test… Take her and leave!”</em> The entity disappeared into the shadows, leaving Hael, Gabriel, Asha, and Seraphina in the empty room.</p>
                <p><strong>A Tearful Reunion.</strong></p>
                <p>Hael ran to Seraphina, embracing her. Emerald green light flowed into her body, healing her wounds and restoring her strength. Seraphina opened her eyes, smiling efeitosly. <em>“Hael… brother… you found me…”</em></p>
                <p>Hael cried, holding Seraphina QuantityOnHandly. <em>“It’s good that you’re okay. I won’t let anyone hurt you again.”</em></p>
                <p>Gabriel and Asha watched, their eyes filled with emotion. They knew Hael had just overcome a great challenge, and he had become stronger than ever.</p>

                <h3>Chapter 21: The Fateful Confrontation</h3>
                <p>Hael, Gabriel, Asha, and Seraphina left the temple, feeling victorious but also wary. They knew Lucifer was still waiting outside, and he surely had another plan.</p>
                <p><strong>Lucifer's Betrayal.</strong></p>
                <p>As they stepped out of the temple, Lucifer was still there, clapping slowly. <em>“Impressive, Hael,”</em> he said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. <em>“I knew you could do it. But I’m afraid the story isn’t over yet.”</em></p>
                <p>Before Hael could react, Lucifer raised his hand, and an army emerged from the forest – not just humans, but also manipulated fallen angels, with empty eyes and bodies covered in dark energy. Leading the army was Kain, his eyes filled with hatred.</p>
                <p><em>“You tricked me!”</em> Hael shouted, emerald green light flaring around him. <em>“You said you would help me save Seraphina, but you just wanted to use me!”</em></p>
                <p>Lucifer laughed QuantityOnHandly, his eyes cold. <em>“I did help you save her, didn’t I? But I didn’t say I would let you go. You are too powerful an angel, Hael. I need you – and if I can’t have you, I will destroy you.”</em></p>
                <p>Seraphina, though still weak, stood up, soft white light flaring from her wings. <em>“Hael, we will fight,”</em> she said, her voice gentle but firm. <em>“Together.”</em></p>
                <p>Asha summoned her fire, and Gabriel raised his hand, brilliant white light ready. Hael nodded, his eyes full of determination. <em>“Alright. If you want to fight, Lucifer, we will fight.”</em></p>
                <p><strong>Michael Joins In.</strong></p>
                <p>Just as the battle was about to begin, the sky above the temple suddenly blazed with golden light. Michael and his angelic host appeared, descending between the two factions. Michael looked at Lucifer, his eyes filled with anger.</p>
                <p><em>“Lucifer, you dare manipulate a fallen angel to fight against Heaven?”</em> Michael roared, his golden sword pointing at Lucifer. <em>“I will destroy you – and Hael as well!”</em></p>
                <p>Hael stepped forward, his emerald green light flaring stronger than ever. <em>“Michael, I am not your enemy. I just want to live freely, and help those who need me. If you want to fight, I will fight – but I will not let you or Lucifer control me!”</em></p>
                <p>Michael laughed coldly. <em>“You have no choice, Healiangel. You are a danger, and I will destroy you right now!”</em></p>
                <p><strong>A Three-Way Battle.</strong></p>
                <p>The battle erupted, with three factions clashing QuantityOnHandly: Hael, Gabriel, Asha, and Seraphina against both Lucifer’s army and Michael’s angelic host. Hael’s emerald green light, Gabriel’s and Seraphina’s white light, and Asha’s brilliant red fire all blended, creating a powerful energy wall, pushing back both opposing factions.</p>
                <p>Lucifer, though outnumbered, maintained his cold smile. He summoned a stream of dark energy, attacking Hael directly. But Hael didn’t flinch – he raised his hand, emerald green light flaring, purifying Lucifer’s dark energy, forcing him back.</p>
                <p>Michael, seeing an opportunity, charged at Hael, his golden sword aimed straight at his chest. But Seraphina rushed in, using her wings to shield Hael. Her white light flared, pushing Michael back, but she was also injured, falling into Hael’s arms.</p>
                <p><em>“Seraphina!”</em> Hael shouted, emerald green light flowing into her body, healing her wounds. But he knew he couldn’t continue like this – every time he used his power, he lost a part of himself.</p>
                <p><strong>A Sacrifice.</strong></p>
                <p>In that moment, Hael realized he couldn’t win by fighting. He remembered Gabriel’s words: <em>“Your strength lies in your heart.”</em> He stood up, emerald green light flaring, not to attack, but to heal.</p>
                <p>Hael raised his hand, and the green light spread across the battlefield, enveloping both Lucifer’s army and Michael’s angelic host. The light caused no harm; on the contrary, it purified the dark energy in Lucifer’s army, freeing the manipulated fallen angels. It also soothed the anger in the hearts of Michael’s angels, causing them to stop fighting.</p>
                <p>Lucifer, realizing his plan had failed, roared: <em>“You think compassion can save you? You’re wrong, Hael!”</em> He lunged, but Hael raised his hand, the green light enveloping Lucifer, purifying a part of the dark energy within him. Lucifer collapsed, and for the first time in history, he felt a sliver of light pierce his soul – a light he had long since abandoned.</p>
                <p>Michael, though still furious, also stopped. He looked at Hael, his gaze wavering. <em>“You… what have you done?”</em> he asked, his voice trembling.</p>
                <p>Hael, though exhausted, smiled efeitosly. <em>“I don’t fight for power, Michael. I fight for compassion – for love. If you can’t understand that, then you don’t deserve to lead Heaven.”</em></p>
                <p><strong>A Temporary End.</strong></p>
                <p>Michael fell silent, thinking. Finally, he turned away, leading his angelic host away from the battlefield. He couldn’t accept Hael’s compassion, but he also couldn’t deny its power.</p>
                <p>Lucifer, though weakened, still smiled. <em>“You won this time, Hael. But I’ll be back – and next time, I won’t be so lenient.”</em> He disappeared into the shadows, leaving Hael and his allies exhausted but victorious.</p>
                <p>Hael knelt beside Seraphina, holding her close. Gabriel and Asha stood by, their eyes full of pride. They knew this battle was only the beginning, but for the first time, they felt a real ray of hope – hope that Hael could change the world, not just for fallen angels, but for humanity and Heaven as well.</p>
                <p><strong>A New Journey.</strong></p>
                <p>Hael looked up at the sky, feeling the emerald green light in his body thrumming gently. He knew he had found his path – the path of compassion, healing, and love. He turned to Gabriel, Asha, and Seraphina, smiling.</p>
                <p><em>“We will continue,”</em> he said. <em>“We will find the other fallen angels, and we will build a new world – a world where no one has to suffer from control or darkness.”</em></p>
                <p>Gabriel nodded, his eyes shining with hope. <em>“I will always be by your side, Hael. We will do it together.”</em></p>
                <p>They embarked on a new journey, unaware that greater challenges still lay ahead. But this time, they were no longer afraid – because they had each other, and they had faith in the power of compassion.</p>

                <p><em>"Lucifer, you dare to manipulate a fallen angel to oppose Heaven?"</em> Michael roared, his golden sword pointed at Lucifer. <em>"I will destroy you – and Hael too!"</em></p>
                <p>Hael stepped forward, the emerald green light flaring stronger than ever. <em>"Michael, I am not your enemy. I just want to live freely, and help those who need me. If you want to fight, I will fight – but I will not let you or Lucifer control me!"</em></p>
                <p>Michael laughed coldly. <em>"You have no right to choose, Healiangel. You are a menace, and I will destroy you right now!"</em></p>
                <p><strong>A Three-Way Battle.</strong></p>
                <p>The battle erupted, with three factions clashing QuantityOnHandly: Hael, Gabriel, Asha, and Seraphina against both Lucifer's army and Michael's angelic host. Hael's emerald green light, Gabriel's and Seraphina's white light, and Asha's brilliant red fire, all intertwined, creating a powerful energy barrier, repelling both opposing sides.</p>

                <h3>Chapter 22: Dawn Amidst the Ashes</h3>
                <p>After the fateful confrontation, a heavy silence fell over the ancient forest. Lucifer's army had disbanded or retreated; the manipulated angels now stood bewildered, pure light gradually returning to their eyes as the dark energy was cleansed. Michael and his angelic host had also vanished, leaving Hael, Gabriel, Asha, and Seraphina amidst the desolate scene.</p>
                <p>Hael slumped to the cold ground, his body exhausted after releasing the immense wave of energy. The familiar pain in his chest still lingered, but this time, it was accompanied by a strange sense of peace. He had faced the darkness, the manipulation, and he had chosen his own path – the path of compassion.</p>
                <p>Seraphina knelt beside him, her soft white wings gently brushing Hael's back. "Are you alright, Hael?" she asked, her voice full of concern.</p>
                <p>Hael nodded, smiling efeitosly. "I'm fine. Just a little tired." He looked around, seeing the newly freed fallen angels watching him with a mixture of gratitude and confusion. "We need to help them."</p>
                <p>Gabriel approached, his eyes filled with pride but also hidden anxiety. "You did very well, Hael. You showed them the true power of compassion. But your actions have also made both Michael and Lucifer realize the threat – and potential – you pose. We must leave here immediately."</p>
                <p>Asha, the fire in her eyes now softened but still warm, agreed. "He's right. We don't know when they'll return, or who will come next. We need to find a safe place."</p>
                <p>Hael looked at the fallen angels gathering. "We'll take them with us," he decided. "They have nowhere else to go. We'll find the others together, and rebuild together."</p>
                <p>Seraphina placed her hand on Hael's. "I believe in you, Hael. I believe in your healing power – not just to heal bodies, but also memories and souls." Her words seemed to touch something deep within Hael, reminding him of his dream and her own words.</p>
                <p>"Healing memories..." Hael murmured. He looked at the fallen angels, their unfamiliar faces yet harboring a familiar pain – the pain of oblivion, of losing one's self. "Perhaps... perhaps that's the key."</p>
                <p>He stood up, though his body still ached. "Mr. Gabriel, Asha, Seraphina, we will head south. My dream... I feel that others are waiting there. And I will try... try to heal their memories."</p>
                <p>Gabriel nodded. "That's a dangerous journey, Hael. Restoring memories can awaken both buried power and pain. But if that's the path you choose, I will go with you."</p>
                <p>Asha and Seraphina also expressed their support. The group, now larger with the addition of the newly freed angels, began their new journey. They left the shadowlands, heading towards an unshaped future, carrying hopes of healing and anxieties of relentless pursuit.</p>
                <p>As the first sunbeams pierced through the canopy after the battle, Hael turned to look at the ruined temple one last time. He knew the road ahead would not be easy, but for the first time after so many lost years, he felt he had a purpose, a family, and a path to follow.</p>

                <h3>Chapter 23: The First Trace and a Blocked Call</h3>
                <p>The journey south took Hael's group through dense forests, across raging rivers, and over treacherous mountain ranges of South America. The newly freed fallen angels, though still bewildered, gradually regained their faith as they witnessed Hael's determination and the kindness of Gabriel, Asha, and Seraphina. They shared fragmented stories of their human lives, the pain and loss they had endured in oblivion.</p>
                <p>Gabriel, with his ability to sense angelic energy, led the group. After many days of travel, he stopped before a lush green valley, hidden among rocky mountains. "I sense a very strong energy here," he said. "It could be one of those we are looking for."</p>
                <p>They entered the valley, the peaceful scenery a stark contrast to the desolate lands they had just traversed. In the middle of the valley was a small village, looking quite prosperous with its charming wooden houses and fertile fields. The villagers looked at Hael's group with curiosity but not hostility.</p>
                <p>As they neared the center of the village, Hael sensed the energy Gabriel had spoken of. It emanated from a middle-aged man sitting pensively by a stream, his face weathered but his eyes shining with an unusual wisdom. He was using a small knife to carve a piece of wood into the shape of a bird.</p>
                <p>"He... there's something very familiar about him," Hael whispered, the green light in his eyes flickering slightly.</p>
                <p>Gabriel nodded. "That's Raziel," he said softly. "The angel of sacred secrets. He once held the knowledge of Heaven."</p>
                <p>Hael approached, offering a greeting. "Excuse me for disturbing you. I am Hael. I feel like we... used to know each other."</p>
                <p>The man looked up, his deep eyes studying Hael intently. He said nothing, just nodded QuantityOnHandly and returned to his work. His silence made Hael feel uneasy.</p>
                <p>"He doesn't seem to want to talk," Asha remarked.</p>
                <p>Seraphina gently said: "Perhaps his lost memory has led him to choose a reclusive life, shunning everyone. Restoring it might be very difficult."</p>
                <p>Just then, a group of strangers, dressed like hunters, appeared at the edge of the village. Their eyes were sharp, and Hael sensed a faint dark energy emanating from them – not as strong as Kain's, but clearly Lucifer's minions.</p>
                <p>"They found us," Gabriel warned, white light ready in his hand.</p>
                <p>The strangers headed straight for Hael, ignoring the villagers. "Hael," one of them spoke. "Lord Lucifer wants to see you. Come with us."</p>
                <p>Hael shook his head. "I'm not going anywhere."</p>
                <p>The confrontation quickly erupted. Villagers fled in panic. Raziel, the man by the stream, remained seated, as if indifferent to the conflict.</p>
                <p>During the fight, Hael suddenly felt an overwhelming homesickness wash over him. Images of Mrs. Lan, the small house by the river, the laughter of the villagers flashed through his mind. He wished he could call home, hear his mother's voice, find a moment of peace amidst the chaos. He retreated a few steps, found a hidden corner, and tried to use the old satellite phone Gabriel had given him.</p>
                <p>He dialed the familiar number, pressed the phone to his ear, his heart pounding. The signal connected... then abruptly died. The phone screen went black. "Impossible!" Hael muttered, trying to turn it back on but to no avail. A strong sense of helplessness and isolation welled up.</p>
                <p>"Hael, watch out!" Asha's shout pulled him back to reality. One of Lucifer's henchmen was charging at him from behind.</p>
                <p>Anger and frustration flared within Hael. The emerald green light didn't just erupt from his hands, but enveloped his entire body, stronger than before. He not only repelled the attacker but also unleashed a wave of healing energy, dispelling the henchmen's weak dark energy, causing them to collapse and fall unconscious.</p>
                <p>The battle ended quickly. Gabriel and Asha looked at Hael with surprise at his new burst of power. But Hael wasn't joyful. He looked at the broken phone in his hand, a growing sense of unease. Someone was deliberately preventing him from contacting home. Was it Lucifer? Or Michael?</p>
                <p>He turned back to look at Raziel, who was still sitting there, but the knife in his hand had stopped. He looked up at Hael, and for the first time, Hael saw a spark of recognition flash in his deep eyes.</p>

                <h3>Chapter 24: Touching Sacred Secrets</h3>
                <p>After the unexpected encounter, Hael's group decided to stay in the village for a while to recover and try to approach Raziel. The villagers, after witnessing Hael's strength and kindness when he helped those lightly injured during the chaos, welcomed them more warmly.</p>
                <p>Hael spent a lot of time sitting by the stream, observing Raziel work. He said nothing, just continued to carve intricate figures from wood – birds, flowers, and even strange symbols that Hael felt vaguely familiar with. Sometimes, Hael tried to strike up a conversation, talking about his journey, about Seraphina, about the other fallen angels, but Raziel only listened silently.</p>
                <p>"He's like a stone wall," Asha sighed, sitting down next to Hael. "How can you heal the memory of someone who doesn't want to remember?"</p>
                <p>Hael looked at Raziel, his eyes thoughtful. "I'm not sure. But I sense a deep pain within him – the pain of losing knowledge, of losing his identity. Perhaps he doesn't want to remember, not because he doesn't want to, but because he's afraid to remember."</p>
                <p>Seraphina gently added: "Raziel once held the greatest secrets of the universe. Losing them must have been a terrible torture. Perhaps you need to approach him with empathy, not with power."</p>
                <p>Hearing Seraphina's words, Hael had an idea. Instead of trying to use his power to restore Raziel's memory, he decided to share his own memories. He closed his eyes, focused his mind, and let the fragmented images in his mind surface – images of a radiant Heaven, the majestic Throne, white wings soaring, and also the pain of exile.</p>
                <p>He placed his hand on Raziel's shoulder, not channeling green light, but only transmitting those emotions, those images. Raziel froze, the knife in his hand falling to the ground. His eyes widened, looking at Hael with astonishment and emotion. Tears – the first tears after centuries of oblivion – began to roll down his weathered cheeks.</p>
                <p>"I... I remember..." Raziel whispered, his voice hoarse. "I remember the light... I remember the knowledge... I am Raziel..."</p>
                <p>His memories began to flood back, not because they were forced, but because Hael's empathy had unlocked the tightly closed door in his soul. He looked at Hael, his eyes no longer distant but filled with the warmth of an older brother. "Healiangel... The Healer... You have returned."</p>
                <p>Hael smiled, but he felt an unusual fatigue spread throughout his body. Sharing memories, though not as painful as healing with pure power, still consumed a part of his mental energy. He staggered, and Gabriel quickly supported him.</p>
                <p>"Are you alright, Hael?" Gabriel asked worriedly.</p>
                <p>Hael nodded. "I'm fine. Just a little tired. But... I did it." He looked at Raziel, feeling an indescribable joy. He had not only found an angel but also discovered a new way to use his power – a way based on connection and understanding.</p>
                <p>Raziel, with his memory restored, stood up. His latent power began to awaken, a faint aura surrounding him. He looked at Hael, his eyes full of gratitude. "Thank you, Healiangel. You have given me back my identity. Now, I will use my remaining knowledge to help you – to help you find the truth and face what is to come."</p>
                <p>Raziel joined Hael's group, bringing with him wisdom and precious fragments of knowledge about Heaven, about Lucifer, and possibly about Michael. His presence added strength and hope to the entire group.</p>
                <p>However, Hael still couldn't forget about the broken phone and his worry for Mother Lan. He tried borrowing phones from the villagers, but every time he tried to call Vietnam, the signal was strangely disturbed or the call was abruptly cut off. This invisible obstruction made Hael even more determined to find out the truth and break the isolation that his enemies were trying to impose on him.</p>

           <div id="chapter-25" class="chapter">
                <h3>Chapter 25: The Tempter's Whisper</h3>
                <p>Hael's group, now joined by Raziel, continued their journey to find other fallen angels. Raziel, with his gradually recovering knowledge, provided valuable clues about the locations of some angels, as well as warnings about the forces tracking them. He also revealed that Hael's inability to contact Vietnam might be due to interference from both Michael and Lucifer, aimed at isolating him mentally.</p>
                <p>One night, while the group was resting in an ancient forest, Hael dreamt of Lucifer again. This time, Lucifer didn't appear threatening or sarcastic, but rather pensive, even somewhat... sad. He stood by a chasm, looking down into the endless darkness.</p>
                <p>"Hael," Lucifer said, his voice lacking its usual mockery. "I know you are searching for your brethren. I also know Michael is relentlessly hunting you. But there is a greater danger that neither you nor he has yet realized."</p>
                <p>Hael was wary. "What trick are you up to now, Lucifer?"</p>
                <p>Lucifer turned, his eyes complex. "No tricks. I just want to tell the truth – a part of the truth. Abyssal, the entity you faced in the temple, is not the only one of its kind. There are older, more powerful forces rising from the darkness, taking advantage of the imbalance after Father's withdrawal. They want to devour everything - Earth, Heaven, and even Hell."</p>
                <p>Hael remained silent, trying to discern truth from falsehood in Lucifer's words. "Why are you telling me this?"</p>
                <p>Lucifer shrugged, a sad smile fleeting across his face. "Perhaps because I too don't want to see everything turn to nothingness. Or perhaps... because I see a part of myself in you, Hael. The loneliness, the burden of power, the struggle between light and darkness." He drew closer, his voice a whisper. "I know a place that houses an ancient artifact – something that can amplify your healing power, help you deal with those forces, and even... break the blockade preventing you from contacting your past."</p>
                <p>Hael felt his heart pound. The chance to speak with Mother Lan, to hear her voice, was too great a temptation. "Where is this place? What is this artifact?"</p>
                <p>Lucifer smiled. "I will show you the way. But you must go alone. Gabriel will not agree, and Michael will surely interfere. This is your own choice, Hael. Trust me, or continue to be isolated and face the darkness alone?"</p>
                <p>Hael woke with a start, Lucifer's words still echoing in his mind. He looked over at Gabriel, Asha, Seraphina, and Raziel, who were fast asleep. He knew Lucifer was setting a trap, but his offer was too enticing. To speak with his mother, to gain more power to protect everyone... What should he do?</p>
                <p>The next morning, Hael said nothing about the dream. He acted normally, but his heart was in turmoil. He knew he shouldn't trust Lucifer, but the homesickness and the longing to connect with his past were gnawing at his soul. Would he be strong enough to refuse the tempter's whisper?</p>
           </div>
           
           <div id="chapter-26" class="chapter">
                <h3>Chapter 26: Diverging Paths</h3>
                <p>The internal conflict made Hael quieter and more distant. Gabriel and the others noticed the change, but Hael always evaded their questions. He was obsessed with Lucifer's offer – the chance to hear Mother Lan's voice again, to break this painful isolation.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Raziel, with his gradually recovering knowledge, identified the location of another fallen angel – Haniel, the angel of joy, who was said to be hiding in a vibrant coastal city in Brazil. The group decided to set out to find Haniel.</p>
                <p>The journey to the coastal city was not easy. They constantly encountered small but suspicious obstacles: suddenly blocked roads, misinformation, and even surprise attacks from Lucifer's low-level henchmen, seemingly just to slow them down.</p>
                <p>Upon reaching the city, they quickly sensed Haniel's energy, but it was very faint and unstable, hidden amidst the noise and bustle of a street festival. They found Haniel working in a small beachfront bar, not with her inherent joy, but as a haggard woman, her eyes empty, lost in alcohol and fleeting pleasures – an image reflecting Hael himself in his lost days.</p>
                <p>"Haniel..." Seraphina whispered, her voice full of sorrow upon recognizing her sister.</p>
                <p>Hael approached, trying to strike up a conversation, but Haniel just laughed dismissively, waving him away. "Another one trying to save me? Get lost. I don't need pity." Clearly, Lucifer's propaganda about a "dangerous healing angel" had reached her ears.</p>
                <p>Just as Hael was trying to persuade Haniel, a mysterious message appeared in his mind – a blurry image of the place Lucifer had mentioned in the dream, along with an overwhelming urge that he had to go there immediately. He knew it was a trap, but the image of Mother Lan reappeared, urging him on.</p>
                <p>At the same time, Gabriel received a report from his remaining sources in Heaven: Michael was closing in on their position, with a more elite army.</p>
                <p>Hael's group was caught in a dilemma. They needed to convince Haniel, deal with Michael's pursuit, and Hael was being tempted by Lucifer's promise.</p>
                <p>"We have to split up," Hael suddenly decided, his eyes complex. "Mr. Gabriel, Asha, you two stay here, try to convince Haniel and deal with Michael if he comes. Seraphina, Raziel, you two come with me. There's a place I have to go."</p>
                <p>Gabriel looked at Hael, his eyes full of worry and disappointment. "Hael, what are you doing? Are you going to follow Lucifer?"</p>
                <p>Hael shook his head, avoiding Gabriel's gaze. "I'm not following him. But there's something I have to resolve myself. I believe that place holds answers... and
           possibly a way for me to contact home. Please trust me."</p>
                <p>Though very worried, Gabriel couldn't stop Hael. He saw the determination, but also the pain in his eyes. "Be careful, Hael. Don't let the darkness consume you."</p>
                <p>Hael nodded, then quickly left with Seraphina and Raziel, heading towards the mysterious location Lucifer had indicated. Gabriel and Asha remained, facing the difficult task of convincing Haniel and preparing for Michael's arrival. Their paths had temporarily diverged, and no one knew if they would ever meet again.</p>

                <h3>Chapter 27: The Relentless Pursuit</h3>
                <p>Gabriel and Asha stayed in the Brazilian coastal city, trying to approach Haniel while remaining highly alert for Michael's arrival. Haniel maintained her indifferent attitude, refusing all attempts at help, deeply influenced by Lucifer's propaganda and the pain of oblivion.</p>
                <p>"Leave me alone!" Haniel snapped when Asha tried to talk to her. "You don't understand. Happiness is just an illusion. In the end, all that's left is emptiness."</p>
                <p>Gabriel patiently explained about Lucifer, about Hael's true nature, but Haniel didn't believe him. "He's dangerous," she said of Hael. "I heard he drains the energy of those he heals. I don't want anything to do with it."</p>
                <p>While they were at a stalemate, the sky suddenly blazed with golden light. Michael and his angelic host had arrived. Without a word of warning, Michael ordered an attack, targeting not only Gabriel and Asha, but also Haniel – whom he considered a fallen angel in need of purification.</p>
                <p>"Gabriel, you have betrayed for too long!" Michael roared, his golden sword slashing towards Gabriel. "And you, fallen ones, will pay the price!"</p>
                <p>Gabriel and Asha were forced to fight to defend themselves and protect Haniel, who was terrified by the sudden attack. Asha used her fire to create a protective circle, while Gabriel confronted Michael directly.</p>
                <p>The battle raged fiercely in the streets, with panicked civilians fleeing. Gabriel, though powerful, struggled to hold his own against Michael, who was in a fit of rage. Asha tried to hold off Michael's angelic host, but the forces were too disparate.</p>
                <p>Haniel, witnessing the scene, initially just watched in fear. But when she saw Asha severely injured by an angel, something stirred within her. Memories of courage, of sisterhood in Heaven, flashed through her mind. She screamed, and a warm, faint but hopeful light – her energy of happiness – erupted, momentarily stunning the attacking angels.</p>
                <p>"Stop!" Haniel shouted, though her voice still trembled. "Don't hurt them!"</p>
                <p>Michael turned to look at Haniel, his eyes full of contempt. "A weak angel of happiness? Do you want to die too?"</p>
                <p>Haniel's unexpected courage created an opening for Gabriel. He focused his energy, creating a dazzling explosion of white light, temporarily blinding Michael's army. "Asha, Haniel, go!" Gabriel shouted, pulling them both into a narrow alley, disappearing before Michael could regain his bearings.</p>
                <p>Michael roared in anger, but he knew he had lost their trail. He ordered his army to continue the search, the ruthlessness in his eyes deepening. He not only wanted to destroy Hael, but also all who dared to oppose his order.</p>
                <p>Gabriel, Asha, and Haniel found temporary shelter. Haniel was still trembling, but her eyes were no longer empty. "I... I'm sorry," she said to Gabriel and Asha. "I was wrong to believe those words. Hael... he's not a bad person, is he?"</p>
                <p>Gabriel smiled with relief. "No, Haniel. He is our hope." He looked in the direction Hael had gone, his heart full of worry. "But now, he is walking into a much more dangerous trap."</p>

           <div id="chapter-28" class="chapter">
                <h3>Chapter 28: The Ancient Artifact and a Distorted Truth</h3>
                <p>Hael, Seraphina, and Raziel followed the vague directions in Hael's mind, venturing deep into a remote mountainous forest area, believed to house the ancient artifact Lucifer had mentioned. The air here was strangely heavy, and Raziel sensed traces of ancient, powerful but chaotic energy.</p>
                <p>"This place is dangerous, Hael," Raziel warned. "This energy... it doesn't belong to Heaven or Hell. It's something else, more primordial."</p>
                <p>Hael nodded, but he didn't stop. The image of Mother Lan and the chance to contact her urged him forward. Finally, they reached a colossal cave, its entrance guarded by ancient symbols that even Raziel only partially recognized.</p>
                <p>Inside the cave, amidst strangely glowing crystals, was a stone pedestal. On the pedestal, a shimmering orb of light levitated, radiating an immense energy, both alluring and terrifying. This was the ancient artifact.</p>
                <p>"This is it," Hael whispered, feeling the orb's power resonating with the green light within him.</p>
                <p>Just then, Lucifer emerged from the shadows, an unreadable smile on his lips. "I knew you would come, Hael."</p>
                <p>Seraphina and Raziel immediately went on the defensive. "Lucifer! What trick are you playing now?" Seraphina demanded.</p>
                <p>Lucifer raised his hand. "Calm down. I just came to see you make your final choice, Hael." He pointed to the orb. "This artifact is the Heart of the Primordial Universe – a source of pure energy that can amplify any ability. It can help you heal all wounds, restore all memories, even connect with loved ones far away... like your mother."</p>
                <p>Hael looked at the orb, then at Lucifer. "What's the price?"</p>
                <p>Lucifer smiled. "There is no price, Hael. Just touch it, absorb its energy. You deserve that power, to protect those you love, to fight Michael, to create a better world."</p>
                <p>"Don't listen to him, Hael!" Raziel warned. "This energy is too powerful and primordial. It can amplify your power, but it can also consume you, turn you into something that is no longer yourself!"</p>
                <p>Hael looked at the orb, the temptation overwhelming. He thought of Mother Lan, of the fallen angels needing healing, of the war with Michael. If he had this power...</p>
                <p>He slowly approached the orb, his trembling hand reaching out. Seraphina called his name, Raziel shouted a warning, but Hael seemed not to hear. His fingers were about to touch the orb of light...</p>
                <p>Suddenly, an image flashed in Hael's mind – not Mother Lan, but the dark version of himself, smiling malevolently. He snatched his hand back, panting. "No..."</p>
                <p>He turned to Lucifer, his eyes no longer wavering but filled with disappointment and anger. "You lied. You don't want me to be stronger to protect others. You want me to be consumed by this energy, so you can control me, or simply eliminate a rival!"</p>
                <p>Lucifer's smile faded, replaced by a cold, ruthless expression. "Clever, Hael. But it's too late." He snapped his fingers, and the symbols on the cave entrance glowed. The entire cave trembled, and the walls began to close in.</p>
                <p>"You can refuse that power, but you can't escape from here," Lucifer said. "Stay here and think about your choice. Perhaps when faced with death, you'll realize which is the right path." He disappeared into the darkness, leaving Hael, Seraphina, and Raziel trapped in the collapsing cave, with the destructive energy orb in the middle.</p>

           <div id="chapter-29" class="chapter">
                <h3>Chapter 29: Uniting Light and Wisdom</h3>
                <p>The cave shook violently, rocks raining down from the ceiling. The exit was completely blocked. The Heart of the Primordial Universe orb in the center of the room radiated increasingly chaotic energy, threatening to consume everything.</p>
                <p>"We're trapped!" Seraphina cried out, trying to use her white light to stabilize the surrounding rocks.</p>
                <p>Raziel looked at the orb, then at Hael. "Hael, there's only one way out of here. You have to absorb the energy of that orb. But not to amplify your power, but to... heal it."</p>
                <p>Hael was surprised. "Heal the orb? But it's a source of energy..."</p>
                <p>"It's a heart, Hael," Raziel explained. "The heart of a universe that died long ago. It contains immense power, but also great pain and chaos from its loss. Lucifer wanted you to absorb that chaos to become uncontrollable. But if you can use your compassion to soothe its pain, perhaps you can stabilize it – and we can get out."</p>
                <p>Hael looked at the orb, this time with different eyes. He sensed the endless pain emanating from it. He took a deep breath, focusing all his compassion. He approached the orb, despite Seraphina and Raziel's worried calls.</p>
                <p>He placed his hand on the orb. An immense, chaotic, and painful energy flooded his body, threatening to tear him apart. But Hael didn't resist. He let his emerald green light flow into the orb, not to absorb, but to soothe, to share, to heal.</p>
                <p>He felt the pain of a lost universe, the loneliness of an abandoned heart. He used his own experiences of being lost, his memories of Mother Lan, of the love he had received, to connect with the orb. His green light merged with the chaotic light of the orb, creating a new light, stable and stronger.</p>
                <p>The entire cave stopped shaking. The orb of light shrank, became gentler, and flew to rest in Hael's palm. He felt a deep connection with it, not of control, but of understanding.</p>
                <p>Just then, a section of the cave wall collapsed, revealing a new passage. But standing there was not an escape route, but Michael and his angelic host. He had tracked the energy signature here.</p>
                <p>"Healiangel!" Michael roared, seeing the orb in Hael's hand. "You dare to seize such an ancient artifact? You truly are a menace!"</p>
                <p>Hael stood up, the orb of light radiating warm energy. "Michael, I didn't seize it. I healed it. And now, I understand balance more than ever."</p>
                <p>He looked at Michael, then towards the cave entrance, where he knew Lucifer might be hiding. He knew the final confrontation was approaching. He raised the orb. "I will not let anyone exploit this power, nor will I let anyone destroy the delicate balance of the universe. Whether it's you, Michael, or Lucifer."</p>
                <p>The light from the orb merged with Hael's green light, creating a radiant aura. The power of the Healer and the wisdom of Raziel (who was channeling supportive energy from behind) seemed to unite within him. He was ready to face his destiny.</p>

                <h3>Chapter 30: The Dawn of Balance</h3>
                <p>The confrontation took place right at the entrance of the ruined cave. Michael, with the fury of a challenged ruler, lunged at Hael. Lucifer also emerged from the shadows, not attacking directly but seeking to exploit the chaos to seize the Heart of the Universe orb.</p>
                <p>But Hael, with his stabilized power and the support of the orb, was no longer the weak Healiangel of before. His green light now not only healed but could also create powerful energy shields, repelling Michael's attacks. He didn't seek to destroy, only to neutralize.</p>
                <p>Seraphina and Asha fought alongside Gabriel and Raziel, against Michael's army and Lucifer's remaining henchmen. Raziel, with his knowledge, pointed out weaknesses in Michael's formation, while Seraphina and Asha used light and fire to protect Hael.</p>
                <p>The battle reached its peak when Hael directly confronted both Michael and Lucifer. Lucifer tried to manipulate Hael with words, evoking his longing for Mother Lan, the injustice he had suffered. Michael used pure power, wanting to crush Hael with the authority of an Archangel.</p>
                <p>Hael closed his eyes, focusing on the orb in his hand. He didn't let anger or fear overcome him. He remembered Mrs. Lan, his village, the people he had met, the kindness he had received and given. He understood that true strength lay not in domination or destruction, but in balance – balance between light and darkness, divinity and humanity, power and compassion.</p>
                <p>He opened his eyes, the light from the orb and from himself flaring brilliantly, yet not dazzling but warm, enveloping the entire battlefield. The light didn't attack anyone, but thấm vào (permeated) every angel, every human, soothing anger, fear, and hatred. Michael's army faltered, the swords in their hands lowering. Lucifer's henchmen also collapsed, the dark energy within them neutralized.</p>
                <p>Michael looked at Hael, his eyes no longer filled with anger, only bewilderment and perhaps, a hint of respect. He realized the iron order he tried to maintain was not the only path, and the power of compassion Hael demonstrated was greater than even his own authority.</p>
                <p>Lucifer, once again touched by Hael's light, felt the emptiness in his soul lessen somewhat. He looked at Hael, no longer as an enemy, but as an interesting counterweight. "You have chosen your path, Healiangel," he said, his smile no longer sarcastic this time. "A boring path, but perhaps... not entirely meaningless."</p>
                <p>Hael didn't reply. He knew the war wasn't over, but a new balance had been established. Michael silently led his army away, perhaps to return to Heaven and rethink everything. Lucifer also vanished into the darkness, leaving behind a promise of complex future encounters.</p>
                <p>Hael turned back to Gabriel, Asha, Seraphina, and Raziel. The orb in his hand shone gently. He looked towards the distant horizon, where he knew Vietnam lay. The longing for Mother Lan still ached, but he no longer felt isolated. He had a new family, a new purpose – to maintain balance, heal the world's wounds, and find other fallen angels.</p>
                <p>The journey was still long, fraught with danger and difficult choices. But Hael was no longer alone. He was Healiangel, the Healer, who carried both an angel's heart and human feelings, standing between light and darkness, ready to face an uncertain future.</p>
                <p>The story ends openly, with Hael and his companions looking towards the dawn, a new dawn not just for them, but for all three realms.</p>

                <h3>Chapter 31: The Call From Home</h3>
                <p>After the confrontation at the ancient cave, Hael's group found temporary shelter in an old monastery perched atop the Andes, where the chaotic energies of the outside world could hardly reach. The Heart of the Primordial Universe orb lay peacefully in Hael's hand, emitting a soft light, its initial chaos soothed by his compassion.</p>
                <p>Hael spent many days recovering and meditating, trying to connect more deeply with the orb. He sensed the latent power within it, not just the ability to amplify energy, but also the ability to connect realms, between past and present. The longing for Mrs. Lan, for his Vietnamese village, resurfaced QuantityOnHandly. He decided to try using the orb to do what he had always wished for – contact home.</p>
                <p>He sat alone in the quiet courtyard of the monastery, placing the orb before him. He closed his eyes, focusing his mind on the image of Mrs. Lan, the thatched-roof house, the riverbank where he had saved little Hoa. His emerald green light merged with the orb's light, creating a pure energy stream, heading towards the distant horizon.</p>
                <p>At first, everything was blurry. He only heard interference, flickering images. Raziel had warned about interference from Michael or Lucifer, and Hael clearly felt it – an invisible energy wall trying to block his connection.</p>
                <p>"No..." Hael whispered, determination surging. He channeled more energy into the orb, not with power, but with love and intense longing. "Mother..."</p>
                <p>The energy wall trembled. A small opening appeared, and through that opening, Hael heard a faint, distant but incredibly familiar voice: <em>"...Hael... my child... where are you?"</em></p>
                <p>It was Mrs. Lan's voice! Hael's heart felt like it would burst. "Mother! It's me! It's Hael!" he shouted in his mind, trying to transmit the message through the energy stream.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Lan's voice came again, a little clearer this time, interspersed with a dry cough: <em>"Hael... I miss you... The village... our village..."</em> Then suddenly, the connection was severed. The energy wall slammed shut, stronger than before, repelling Hael's efforts.</p>
                <p>Hael opened his eyes, panting, tears streaming down his face. He had heard his mother's voice, even if only for a moment. But her weak voice and cough made him extremely worried. "Mother isn't well... Is something wrong in the village?" He looked at the orb, then towards distant Vietnam, his heart filled with unease and determination. He had to find a way to break this blockade, he had to return.</p>
                <p>Gabriel, Seraphina, Asha, and Raziel approached, sensing the energy fluctuation. "What happened, Hael?" Gabriel asked.</p>
                <p>Hael wiped his tears, his eyes resolute. "I heard my mother's voice. But she's not well. And someone is deliberately preventing me from making contact. We have to find out who it is – and I have to find a way back to Vietnam."</p>
                <p>Raziel nodded. "This orb can help you, but breaking such a strong energy blockade requires more than just raw power. We need to find more allies, and perhaps... understand Michael's and Lucifer's plans better."</p>
                <p>Their journey gained a new, urgent, and deeply personal goal for Hael. The call from home had become a powerful driving force, compelling him to face any danger that lay ahead.</p>

           <div id="chapter-32" class="chapter">
                <h3>Chapter 32: New Clues and the Uprising</h3>
                <p>Drawing on his gradually recovering knowledge and refined energy-sensing abilities, Raziel identified the potential location of another fallen angel – Jophiel, the angel of wisdom and beauty, believed to be hiding in an ancient library in Europe.</p>
                <p>The group left the Andean monastery, beginning their journey across the ocean. They moved cautiously, trying to conceal their energy signatures from the prying eyes of Michael and Lucifer. Along the way, Hael continuously practiced his new ability: healing memories. He practiced on the newly freed fallen angels accompanying them. This process was not easy, demanding patience and deep empathy. Each restored memory came with intense emotions – joy, sorrow, regret – but gradually, these angels began to remember their true selves, their latent powers also beginning to awaken efeitosly.</p>
                <p>Hael realized that healing memories not only helped others but also helped him understand more about Heaven's past, the cause of the fall, and his own role. However, each time he performed it, he also felt his mental energy significantly depleted.</p>
                <p>Their journey was far from peaceful. They constantly encountered seemingly "random" obstacles: last-minute flight cancellations, inexplicably blocked roads, and sometimes brief encounters with strangers carrying faint dark energy, apparently just to probe and delay their progress. Gabriel suspected these were Lucifer's moves, aiming to hold them back while he executed his own plans.</p>
                <p>Finally, they reached the ancient European city, home to a colossal library containing millions of rare books. Jophiel's energy was very subtle, almost blending into the scholarly atmosphere of the place.</p>
                <p>They found Jophiel working as an elderly librarian, quietly arranging old books. She had an ordinary appearance, silver hair, eyes hidden behind thick glasses, but Hael sensed a faint aura of wisdom surrounding her.</p>
                <p>Approaching Jophiel was also not easy. She was aloof, unwilling to interact with strangers, and seemed perfectly content with her secluded life among the pages. "The knowledge in these books is more reliable than hazy memories," she said when Hael tried to bring up the past.</p>
                <p>Hael understood that Jophiel, the angel of wisdom, perhaps feared facing the truth that even her wisdom could not prevent Heaven's collapse. He decided to use a method similar to the one with Raziel – sharing his emotions and fragments of memories, evoking empathy instead of forcing it.</p>
                <p>While Hael was trying to connect with Jophiel, Raziel discovered disturbing signs in the library – ancient symbols carved hiddenly, carrying the energy of the dark forces Lucifer had mentioned. It seemed this place was not only Jophiel's refuge but also an important location for the rising ancient powers.</p>
           </div>
           
           <div id="chapter-33" class="chapter">
                <h3>Chapter 33: Encountering a Traitor?</h3>
                <p>Hael patiently approached Jophiel, not with words or power, but with a quiet presence and shared emotions. He sat with her in the library, reading books, and occasionally, he let images of Heaven, of the beauty of pure knowledge, seep into her mind.</p>
                <p>Gradually, Jophiel's defensive wall began to crack. She started asking hesitant questions about the past, about other angels. One afternoon, as Hael was talking about Seraphina, Jophiel burst into tears. Memories of her beloved sister, of Heaven's lost beauty, flooded back, shattering the shell she had built for so long.</p>
                <p>"I remember... I am Jophiel..." she whispered, tears streaming down. "I tried to forget... because the pain was too great."</p>
                <p>Hael gently placed a hand on her shoulder, his soft green light conveying comfort. Jophiel's recollection brought joy to the group, but their happiness was short-lived as danger struck.</p>
                <p>Another group of angels suddenly appeared in the library. They were not Michael's, nor did they carry Lucifer's dark energy. Leading them was an angel with a stern face, introducing himself as Raguel, the angel of justice.</p>
                <p>"Healiangel," Raguel said, his voice devoid of emotion. "We are here under the orders of the interim High Council of Angels. You and your followers are accused of causing severe imbalance and must return to Heaven for judgment."</p>
                <p>Gabriel was stunned. "Interim High Council of Angels? Who gave you that authority?"</p>
                <p>Raguel looked at Gabriel coldly. "After Michael left and Heaven fell into chaos, some of the remaining Archangels formed the Council to maintain order. And we have decided that Healiangel is a threat that needs to be eliminated or controlled."</p>
                <p>Hael stepped forward. "I am not causing imbalance. I am trying to heal it. Don't you understand?"</p>
                <p>"Your presence, your power, and your gathering of these fallen ones are the threat," Raguel retorted. "You have two choices: come with us, or be destroyed."</p>
                <p>The confrontation erupted right in the ancient library. Raguel and the angels of justice fought with terrifying discipline and strength. Gabriel, Asha, Seraphina, and Raziel tried to fight back. Jophiel, though newly recovered, also used her wisdom to find weaknesses in the enemy's tactics.</p>
                <p>Hael realized this was not just a battle of strength, but also a battle of ideals. He didn't want to fight angels who were once his brothers, but he couldn't let them impose their blind "justice" on him and the others.</p>
                <p>During the chaos, Hael noticed an angel in Raguel's group who seemed hesitant, his eyes revealing doubt. He recognized him as Jeremiel, the angel of visions and hope. Perhaps Jeremiel didn't fully believe in the Council's orders.</p>
                <p>Hael decided to try using his ability to connect. He focused on Jeremiel, transmitting images of compassion, of hope for a peaceful future, of the pain of the fallen angels. Jeremiel faltered, the sword of light in his hand trembling.</p>
                <p>"Jeremiel! What are you doing?" Raguel yelled.</p>
                <p>Jeremiel looked at Hael, then at Raguel, the conflict clear on his face. Could hope overcome rigid justice? Jeremiel's hesitation created a decisive moment in the battle.</p>
           </div>
           
           <div id="chapter-34" class="chapter">
                <h3>Chapter 34: The Price of Hope</h3>
                <p>Jeremiel's hesitation briefly threw Raguel's ranks into disarray. Gabriel and the others seized the opportunity to counter-attack, pushing back the angels of justice. Hael continued to focus on Jeremiel, conveying feelings of hope and the truth about his purpose.</p>
                <p>"Jeremiel, look at the truth!" Hael said telepathically. "True justice is not punishment, but understanding and healing. There is still hope for all of us!"</p>
                <p>Jeremiel lowered his weapon, shaking his head at Raguel. "I can't do this, Raguel. Healiangel is not the enemy. Perhaps... perhaps we are the ones who are mistaken."</p>
                <p>"Traitor!" Raguel roared, raising his sword to strike Jeremiel. But Gabriel intervened in time.</p>
                <p>Jeremiel's resistance and the combined strength of Hael's group made Raguel realize his disadvantage. "You may have won this time, Healiangel," Raguel said, his voice full of fury. "But the Council will not let this go. We will be back." With that, Raguel and the remaining angels vanished in a flash of light.</p>
                <p>Jeremiel remained, looking at Hael and his group with a complex expression. "I... I apologize," he said. "I blindly followed orders."</p>
                <p>Hael smiled, stepping forward to place a hand on Jeremiel's shoulder. "It's alright. What matters is that you chose hope." He used his green light, not to heal memories, but to soothe the spiritual wounds and confusion in Jeremiel's heart.</p>
                <p>Connecting with and healing Jeremiel, along with the intense battle, exhausted Hael. He felt his energy severely depleted, and the Heart of the Universe orb within him also dimmed. He staggered and collapsed, unconscious.</p>
                <p>"Hael!" Seraphina and Asha cried out, rushing to support him.</p>
                <p>Gabriel checked Hael's condition, his face showing clear concern. "He used too much energy, especially mental energy to connect with Raziel and Jeremiel. Healing memories and emotions is very draining. He needs time to recover completely."</p>
                <p>Raziel nodded. "And we need a safer place. Raguel will report back to the Council, and Michael is surely still hunting us. Lucifer won't sit idle either."</p>
                <p>Jeremiel, now fully on their side, spoke up. "I know a place. An ancient, forgotten sanctuary where our energies can be concealed. That place also holds prophecies about balance... and about the price that must be paid."</p>
                <p>The group decided to trust Jeremiel. They carried the unconscious Hael, along with Jophiel and the other angels, leaving the library, embarking on a journey to the ancient sanctuary, hoping to find refuge and answers for the future, but also acutely aware of the price Hael was paying for the hope he brought.</p>
           </div>
           
           <div id="chapter-35" class="chapter">
                <h3>Chapter 35: A Fragile Alliance and Unending Longing</h3>
                <p>Jeremiel led the group to a hidden valley deep in the Alps, where an ancient sanctuary built of white stone stood concealed behind a majestic waterfall. The place radiated a peaceful energy, helping to shield their presence from outside forces.</p>
                <p>Hael gradually regained consciousness after days in a coma, but he was still very weak. The Heart of the Universe orb within him also needed time to recover its energy. He spent most of his time resting and meditating, trying to regain his strength.</p>
                <p>During this time, the newly formed alliance began to face internal challenges. The fallen angels carried wounds and pain from their past. Asha and Jophiel sometimes clashed due to their contrasting personalities – one fiery, the other calm. Raziel and Jeremiel debated the meaning of ancient prophecies found in the sanctuary. Seraphina tried to maintain harmony, but the burden of caring for Hael and worries about the future also wore her down.</p>
                <p>Hael, though weak, still tried to use his compassion to reconcile conflicts. He listened to each person's story, shared their pain, and reminded them of their common goal. But he himself was struggling with his own burden. The responsibility of leadership grew, his strength fluctuated, and the longing for Mother Lan, for his Vietnamese village, remained a constant, nagging ache.</p>
                <p>Every night, he would look up at the starry sky from the sanctuary, wondering what his mother was doing, whether she was safe. The feeling of isolation, of being prevented from connecting with his human roots, sometimes made him feel desperate. The Heart of the Universe orb could help him sense life on Earth, but it couldn't completely break down the wall separating him from his homeland.</p>
                <p>Raziel, after days of studying ancient texts in the sanctuary, found a disturbing prophecy. "It speaks of the Healer," he announced to the group. "That to truly restore balance, the Healer must make an ultimate sacrifice – to give up a part of his being, possibly his divinity or humanity, to unite light and darkness."</p>
                <p>The prophecy shocked everyone, especially Hael. Would he have to give up his humanity, his memories of Mother Lan, to fulfill his mission? Or would he have to renounce his angelic power, becoming fully mortal?</p>
                <p>While they were in turmoil, Lucifer appeared again, not directly, but through a subtle energy message that only Hael could perceive. <em>"You see, Hael? The path of compassion always demands sacrifice,"</em> Lucifer's voice whispered. <em>"But there is another way. Come meet me. I can give you the power to change everything without giving up anything."</em></p>
                <p>Hael dismissed Lucifer's temptation, but the prophecy and his homesickness plunged him into deep contemplation. He stood alone on the highest cliff of the sanctuary, looking towards the distant horizon, wondering about the path ahead, the price to pay, and whether he could find balance for the world without losing himself. Their alliance was fragile, enemies still lurked, and the longing for home burned fiercely in his heart.</p>
           </div>
           
           <div id="chapter-36" class="chapter">
                <h3>Chapter 36: The Healer's Choice</h3>
                <p>The following days at the sanctuary passed in tension and contemplation. Hael spent more time connecting with the Heart of the Universe orb, trying to find answers in its ancient energy. He felt the conflict between his divine and human nature growing more pronounced. On one hand, his angelic power yearned to be fully unleashed to restore order, to protect those he loved. On the other hand, memories of Mrs. Lan, of the simple life in his village, of the very "human" emotions he had experienced, held him back, reminding him of the value of finitude and simple love.</p>
                <p>The prophecy of the ultimate sacrifice haunted him. Did he really have to choose? To abandon his human side to become a purely powerful entity, or to renounce his angelic strength to live an ordinary life, which would mean being unable to protect the world from a
           looming threats?</p>
                <p>Gabriel and the others tried to offer advice, but they knew this was a choice Hael had to make himself. Seraphina shared memories of Hael's kindness and sacrifice while still in Heaven. Raziel and Jophiel provided philosophical perspectives on the nature of balance and existence. Asha and Haniel recounted their human experiences, the joys and sorrows of a finite life. Jeremiel reminded him of hope, that there was always a third way, however difficult.</p>
                <p>While Hael was struggling internally, he received another message from Lucifer. This time, not a temptation, but a warning: <em>"Michael is gathering his final forces. He no longer trusts the Council; he believes only complete purification will bring order. He will reach this sanctuary soon. And it's not just him; the ancient forces are also sensing the orb's energy and your presence."</em></p>
                <p>Lucifer's message, though its motive was unclear, pushed Hael to a final decision. He could delay no longer. He gathered everyone.</p>
                <p>"I have been thinking," Hael said, his voice calm but resolute. "The prophecy speaks of sacrifice, of abandoning a part of oneself. But I believe true balance is not about abandonment, but acceptance and unification."</p>
                <p>He looked at the Heart of the Universe orb shining in his hand. "I will not abandon my human side, my memories of my mother, of my homeland. That is the source of my compassion, of the love that has guided me here. But I will not abandon my angelic power either, for it is the tool with which I protect what I hold dear."</p>
                <p>"So what do you intend to do?" Gabriel asked.</p>
                <p>Hael looked directly into each person's eyes. "I will face Michael, Lucifer, and any force that wishes to shatter the balance. I will use the power of this orb, not to amplify myself, but to connect all – light and darkness, angel and human. I will try to heal the rift in this universe, through the very unification within me."</p>
                <p>It was a risky choice, a path no one had ever taken. But looking into Hael's determined eyes, his companions knew he had found his own answer. They were ready to stand by him, to face the final battle.</p>
           </div>
           
           <div id="chapter-37" class="chapter">
                <h3>Chapter 37: The Final Battle for Balance</h3>
                <p>The sky above the ancient sanctuary turned a grim gray, dark clouds swirling. Michael, with his last loyal angelic legion, appeared with overwhelming force. His golden sword blazed, ready for the final purification.</p>
                <p>Simultaneously, from the deep shadows of the valley, dark energy surged. Lucifer appeared, but this time, he was not alone. Beside him were ancient shadow entities, more powerful Abyssals, drawn by the energy of the Heart of the Universe orb and the impending chaos. It seemed Lucifer had temporarily allied with them, or at least was using their presence to achieve his own ends.</p>
                <p>Hael's group stood caught between two fires. On one side was Michael and the Heavenly host, wanting to impose order with an iron fist. On the other was Lucifer and the dark forces, wanting to seize power or plunge everything into chaos.</p>
                <p>"This is your last chance, Healiangel!" Michael roared. "Surrender the orb and accept judgment, or be destroyed along with these traitors and the darkness!"</p>
                <p>Lucifer chuckled. "Don't listen to him, Hael. Only absolute power can survive. Join me in controlling this orb, and we shall rule all!"</p>
                <p>Hael looked at the two adversaries, then at his friends standing by his side. He clenched the orb in his hand, the green light and the orb's light merging into one, radiating a powerful yet gentle energy.</p>
                <p>"You are both wrong," Hael said, his voice echoing throughout the valley. "Balance does not come from domination or destruction. It comes from understanding and acceptance."</p>
                <p>He raised the orb high. "I will not let anyone exploit this power!"</p>
                <p>The final battle erupted. Michael attacked Hael with all the might of an Archangel. Lucifer, while fending off Michael, also tried to attack Hael and seize the orb. The shadow entities lunged at anyone who carried light.</p>
                <p>Gabriel, Asha, Seraphina, Raziel, Jophiel, and Jeremiel fought together, protecting Hael and resisting both factions. Gabriel confronted Michael, trying to awaken his former brother. Asha and Seraphina used fire and light against the Abyssals. Raziel and Jophiel used their wisdom to unravel energy attacks. Jeremiel used hope to encourage everyone's spirits.</p>
                <p>Hael stood in the eye of the storm, not attacking directly. He used the energy from the orb and his compassion to create an expanding protective energy field, shielding his allies while weakening those filled with hatred and lust for power. He tried to heal the madness in Michael, the emptiness in Lucifer, and the pain of the shadow entities.</p>
                <p>This process was incredibly painful and exhausting. Hael felt both his divine and human nature being stretched to their limits. Memories of Mrs. Lan, of Heaven, of intertwined joys and sorrows, tore at his mind. He faced the danger of being consumed by chaotic energy.</p>

           <div id="chapter-38" class="chapter">
                <h3>Chapter 38: The Sacrifice of the Heart</h3>
                <p>The battle grew increasingly fierce. Michael, his reason clouded by stubbornness and fear of chaos, relentlessly attacked Hael. Lucifer, though affected by Hael's light, still hadn't abandoned his ambition to control. The Abyssal entities grew stronger as they absorbed the chaos of the battle.</p>
                <p>Hael realized that merely defending and healing wasn't enough. His energy was depleting, and the Heart of the Universe orb was also becoming unstable again. He saw Seraphina gravely injured while trying to protect him from an Abyssal's attack. He saw Gabriel exhausted from confronting Michael. He saw Asha and the others gradually being overwhelmed.</p>
                <p>The prophecy echoed in his mind again: "...must make an ultimate sacrifice – to give up a part of his being... to unite light and darkness."</p>
                <p>Hael understood what he had to do. This was not about abandoning his divine or human nature, but about abandoning the separation between them. He had to fully accept both parts of his being, merge them into one, and use that very unification to heal the greatest rift – the rift in the heart of the universe that the orb represented.</p>
                <p>But what was the price? He didn't know. Maybe he would no longer be the Hael everyone knew. Maybe he would dissolve into that endless energy.</p>
                <p>He looked at Seraphina being tended to by Asha, at Gabriel fighting steadfastly, at Raziel, Jophiel, Jeremiel... his friends, his siblings who had gone through so much with him. Then he thought of Mother Lan, of his peaceful village. The love for them became his final strength.</p>
                <p>"I'm sorry, Mother..." Hael whispered.</p>
                <p>He clutched the orb to his chest, letting his green light completely merge with the ancient energy. He no longer tried to control or heal it from the outside, but became a part of it. He accepted both the radiant light of an angel and the finite darkness of a human within him. He accepted the pain of the lost universe and the hope for a balanced future.</p>
                <p>A colossal explosion of energy, yet not destructive but incredibly gentle, emanated from Hael. Pure light enveloped the entire sanctuary. The Abyssal entities shrieked and then dissolved into the light. Michael's army ceased fighting, their swords falling. Michael looked at Hael, who was levitating in mid-air, enveloped in light, his eyes filled with astonishment and, perhaps, regret.</p>
                <p>Lucifer was also pushed back by the wave of light. He looked at Hael, his familiar smile gone, replaced by a complex, indescribable expression. He knew Hael had done what he himself had never dared to do – to confront and fully accept his own being.</p>
                <p>When the light subsided, Hael slowly descended to the ground. He no longer held the orb; it had merged with him. His emerald green eyes were now deeper, holding both the light of an angel and the warmth of a human. He looked stronger, yet also tinged with an infinite sadness.</p>
                <p>He had succeeded in unifying and temporarily restoring balance. But what was the cost? He felt his memories of Mrs. Lan, of the minute details of human life, seem more distant, like a beautiful dream that no longer fully belonged to him. He still remembered, still loved, but a part of the direct connection seemed to have been severed by this great unification.</p>

                <h3>Chapter 39: A New Order and a Silent Farewell</h3>
                <p>Silence enveloped the sanctuary after the battle. Michael approached Hael, his eyes no longer hostile. "You... you did it," he said, his voice somewhat hesitant. "You showed me another way. Perhaps... the order I tried to impose was not true justice." He bowed his head, an unprecedented gesture. "Heaven needs a change. And perhaps, you are the one worthy of leading."</p>
                <p>Hael shook his head. "I don't want to lead anyone, Michael. I only want balance, understanding. Return to Heaven, take with you what you have seen today. Rebuild it based on love, not fear."</p>
                <p>Michael looked at Hael for a long moment, then nodded. He signaled to his army, and they vanished in a golden light, returning to Heaven.</p>
                <p>Lucifer also approached, his expression no longer sarcastic. "You surprised me, Healiangel. You chose a path I never dared to choose." He looked at Hael with a scrutinizing gaze. "So now what? Will you become the new Messiah?"</p>
                <p>"No," Hael replied. "I will continue my journey, seeking and healing other fallen angels. And maintaining the balance I have just established." He looked directly into Lucifer's eyes. "And you, Lucifer? Will you continue to sow chaos, or will you find another path?"</p>
                <p>Lucifer smiled faintly, a rare genuine smile. "Me? I am who I am. But perhaps... this world will be a little more interesting with your new balance." He shrugged. "We will meet again, Healiangel." Then he too disappeared into the darkness.</p>
                <p>Hael turned back to his friends. Gabriel, Asha, Seraphina, Raziel, Jophiel, Jeremiel, and the angels whose memories had just been healed, all looked at him with eyes full of hope and respect.</p>
                <p>"We did it," Seraphina said, hugging her brother QuantityOnHandly.</p>
                <p>Hael hugged his sister back, but a silent sorrow welled up within him. He felt the growing distance from his human past. He still remembered Mother Lan, still loved her, but the direct connection, the intense emotions of a son, seemed to have faded after the unification.</p>
                <p>"We need to go," Gabriel said. "This place is no longer safe. We need to find a place to rebuild, to gather the others."</p>
                <p>The group agreed. They left the sanctuary, beginning a new chapter in their journey. Hael led the way, the light emanating from him warm, guiding those who followed. He knew his responsibility was now immense.</p>
                <p>But as they walked, Hael silently looked towards distant Vietnam. He couldn't call, couldn't return as an ordinary son anymore. His sacrifice to bring balance to the universe also meant he had to accept a permanent distance from his human origins. It was a silent farewell, a private pain only he understood.</p>

                <h3>Chapter 40: The Keeper of Balance (Open Ending)</h3>
                <p>Many years passed. Hael, along with his ever-growing angelic alliance, had traveled across the Earth, finding and healing hundreds of other fallen angels. They didn't build a new Heaven, but created small communities, safe havens where angels could learn to live in harmony with humans and with their own restored identities.</p>
                <p>Hael became the Keeper of Balance, a symbol of hope and reconciliation. His power, nurtured by compassion and the unification of his divine and human nature, not only healed wounds but also had the ability to connect souls, helping them understand each other. He was no longer tormented by internal conflict but fully accepted his complex being.</p>
                <p>Heaven, under the somewhat changed leadership of Michael and influenced by what had happened, began to transform. Order was still maintained, but it was no longer as harsh as before. Some angels even began to seek ways to reconnect with their fallen brethren on Earth.</p>
                <p>Lucifer remained an enigma. Occasionally, he would appear, sometimes causing trouble, sometimes surprisingly helping Hael in incomprehensible ways. Their relationship became more complex, not quite enemies, not quite friends, but like two opposite sides of the same coin, coexisting to maintain a dynamic state of balance.</p>
                <p>The ancient dark forces had not completely disappeared. They lurked, waiting for an opportunity when the balance would once again falter. Hael and his alliance always had to be vigilant, ready to face new threats.</p>
                <p>As for Hael, though he had become a powerful and respected entity, he always carried a private sorrow in his heart. He would often stand alone, looking towards Vietnam, where his Mother Lan had probably grown old, or perhaps even passed from the mortal world. He couldn't return as a son, couldn't embrace her, couldn't share his burdens. The Heart of the Universe orb within him helped him feel the life and sorrow of the world, but it was also a constant reminder of his sacrifice.</p>
                <p>Sometimes, he used his power to silently protect that small village from afar, ensuring no supernatural forces violated its peace. It was the only way he could express the love and unbreakable bond with his human origins.</p>
                <p>The story of Healiangel, the Healer, the Keeper of Balance, continues. His journey is endless, as is the struggle between light and darkness, order and chaos, love and indifference. The future remains uncertain, but Hael and his companions will continue to walk forward, carrying hope and compassion, like guiding stars in the dark night of the universe.</p>

           <div id="epilogue-en" class="chapter"> <h3>Epilogue: The Whirlpools of Destiny</h3>
            <p>Time flew by. Earth, Heaven, and even the hidden realms gradually grew accustomed to a new order, a fragile balance maintained by Healiangel and his companions. The event at the ancient sanctuary had become a legend, a reminder of the power of compassion and the price of harmony.</p>
            <p>In Heaven, Archangel Michael, with the wisdom gained from bitter experience and what he had witnessed from Hael, initiated extensive reforms. Justice was no longer synonymous with unfeeling punishment but was executed with compassion and understanding. The gates of Heaven, though not fully open, were no longer sealed shut to lost souls who repented. Quiet dialogues began to sprout between the angels in Heaven and some fallen angel communities on Earth.</p>
            <p>On Earth, the fallen angel communities that Hael and his alliance had built became oases of hope and healing. They did not try to recreate a miniature Heaven but learned to live in harmony with humanity, contributing to the world's development in quiet yet meaningful ways. Gabriel became a wise counselor, guiding young angels to find their way. Asha, her fire now warmer rather than scorching, along with Seraphina, with her gentle light, continued to be strong protectors of the vulnerable. Raziel and Jophiel devoted their boundless knowledge to enlighten and guide, while Jeremiel ceaselessly sowed seeds of hope in the darkest places.</p>
            <p>As for Hael, the Keeper of Balance, he continued to walk his endless path. He was no longer the pure angel of his early days, nor entirely the human he had once experienced. He was a unification, an entity embodying both the dazzling light of an angel and the profound sentiments, the warmth of humanity. His emerald green eyes now saw through the energy flows of the universe, sensing every pulse of life, every pain and joy of all creation. The Heart of the Universe had become one with him, and he felt his heavy yet glorious responsibility.</p>
            <p>Occasionally, in the quiet nights, when standing on a high mountain peak looking down upon the mortal world, he would gaze towards Vietnam. Memories of Mother Lan, of the simple thatched-roof house by the river, were still there, like a gentle yet distant melody in his soul. He could not touch it, could not return as an ordinary son anymore. That love, that longing, was a core part of what made him who he was, what forged the boundless compassion of the Healer. His sacrifice had brought peace to many, to many realms, but it also left within him an eternal silence, an unspoken farewell. And he accepted it, as an inevitable part of the balance he had chosen to preserve.</p>

        <div id="after-credit-en" class="chapter"> <h3>After-Credit: Echoes from the Abyss</h3>
            <p><strong>Scene 1:</strong></p>
            <p><em>A dark, chaotic space at the edge of reality, where ancient shadow entities had once been repelled by Hael's cleansing light. The space is eerily silent.</em></p>
            <p>Suddenly, a faint ripple of energy, black as ink, gently stirs. From the void, a small, almost invisible crack begins to appear on the fabric of space. From that crack, a cold black mist, carrying resentment and a thirst for destruction, slowly seeps out.</p>
            <p>An ancient voice, whispering and haunting, composed of many blended voices, echoes from the nameless abyss:</p>
            <p><em>"...Balance... is only temporary..."</em></p>
            <p><em>"...His light... soothed the Heart..."</em></p>
            <p><em>"...But it could not completely cleanse the Primordial Abyss..."</em></p>
            <p><em>"...We... shall return... When the stars misalign... and darkness once again has the chance to devour the light..."</em></p>
            <p>The crack widens slightly then contracts again, like a malevolent eye, observing, waiting.</p>
            <p><strong>Scene 2:</strong></p>
            <p><em>Los Angeles. The luxurious penthouse of Lux Foundation. Night.</em></p>
            <p>Lucifer stands with his back to the large window, gazing at the neon lights of the sleepless city below. A glass of red wine sways in his hand. He smirks, a mysterious and calculating smile flitting across his lips.</p>
            <p>Kain, with his usual cold expression, enters the room, bowing respectfully:</p>
            <p>"Sir, the 'seeds' have been sown in the locations you designated. The new plan... has begun to activate."</p>
            <p>Lucifer doesn't turn around, merely swirls the wine in his glass, his gaze distant.</p>
            <p>"Very good, Kain. Michael is busy with his new Heaven. Healiangel is preoccupied with his so-called 'balance.' They don't know that in this chess game, the most patient player is the one who wins."</p>
            <p>He brings the glass to his lips, taking a sip.</p>
            <p>"This game... is far from over, Healiangel. Far from it."</p>
            <p><em>The camera pans out, focusing on an exquisite chessboard on Lucifer's desk. The pieces have been rearranged. A black Queen is placed in a strategic, meaningful position, ready for an unexpected move.</em></p>
