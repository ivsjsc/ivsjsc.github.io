                <h3>Chapter 1: Farewell to the Throne</h3>
                <p>The consequence of the Broken Veil (or perhaps, Healiangel's own paradoxical act of sacrifice to patch it up with a hybrid entity) is not just the scars of war on the angel's wings or the heavy silence that replaces the eternal harmony. It is a deeper rift, a leakage of chaotic energy that even the purest light of Heaven cannot fully heal. The sky of the heavenly realm was no longer infinitely blue, but variegated with strange dark patches, where the void energy from the outside was still smoldering. The common light of Heaven, the source of life for all creation here, is weakening, its pulse becoming weak and uncertain.</p>
                <p>In the Great Hall of Light, which was once the center of power and glory, it was now enveloped by an atmosphere of mourning. The angels, from the fiery Seraphim to the cherubim guarding, both the faithful and the fallen who had just witnessed the fall of Lucifer's leader, gathered in silence. The splendor of the past is only a memory. Fear, an emotion alien to the angelic being, is now clearly present in every eye, every trembling of the wings. They looked at each other, at the cracks in the energy that were spreading on the crystal walls that were once as solid as eternity, and at the common light that was fading like a lamp in the wind. A silent, anguished question echoes in everyone's mind: Where is the Creator? Why is He silent in the face of the approaching decline?</p>
                <p>At that moment, as if in response to that silent and desperate prayer, the Throne in the center of the Great Hall suddenly lit up. But this time the light was no longer a dazzling, majestic aura that made all creatures bow down. It has an unusual tenderness, a warm pale yellow but tinged with a melancholy expression, a hint of the fatigue of millennia of observation and waiting. God is present, not with absolute power to crush everything, but as a Father who watches his children go astray after destroying his own home.</p>
                <p>His voice rang out, not the thunder of an order, but a vast, deep whisper that permeated the entire universe. It does not resound from a specific direction, but as if it is the air, the light that remains, is speaking, touching the depths of every soul trembling with fear and hope.</p>
                <p>"I have given you freedom, the most precious gift, the foundation of conscious existence itself. I give it not for you to submit blindly, but for you to create your own destiny, learn by experience, and grow in your own light. I have given you knowledge, a double-edged sword, so that you can distinguish between good and evil, so that you can understand the value of choice. I have given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, countless times, even to the first traitor, the one who bears the light but chooses the darkness."</p>
                <p>His voice stopped for a beat, a heavy silence that seemed to contain the disappointment of a Creator. His sigh seemed to shake the whole of Heaven.</p>
                <p>"But the balance is still broken. Freedom, without responsibility and humility, inevitably leads to chaos. Power, if not guided by love and understanding, will eventually become an instrument of destruction. You have seen the consequences. You have tasted the price of pride and blindness."</p>
                <p>The light from the Golden Throne softened a little more, becoming as fragile as the last candle of the night. The last message took shape.</p>
                <p>"Now, I give you the final lesson, the greatest challenge, the only opportunity to truly understand the meaning of what I have given: the Earth. A finite world, a particle of dust in the middle of the vast universe, but it contains the complexity and beauty of fragile life itself. Where joy and pain always go hand in hand like day and night. Where life and death are two sides of the same coin, part of the eternal cycle that you, the immortals, have never really understood."</p>
                <p>His voice became more earnest, like a trusting mandate but also a stern one.</p>
                <p>"Let's go down there. Forget about wings and power. Learn to exist as the flesh-and-blood weak creatures you once despised. Learn to love when immortality is no longer the fulcrum, when every moment becomes precious. Learn to find the light in the finitude itself, in the darkness of suffering, in the small daily choices between good and evil. It was the last school. Where you have to face your own naked self, where you have to prove the true worth of your soul, not by strength, but by maturity."</p>
                <p>And then, the last words sounded, not a farewell, but an affirmation of a new era of freedom and responsibility:</p>
                <p>"From now on, the choice and the consequences are entirely yours. I will step back and observe your growth in true freedom."</p>
                <p>Finishing his words, the bright light on the Throne did not go out completely, but shrunk, withdrawing from his direct expression. It is no longer the sun that illuminates every corner, but becomes a distant aura, a latent presence, like the heart of the universe still beating but no longer involved in every breath. The feeling of God's almighty, direct presence disappears from Heaven.</p>
                <p>Along with that retreat, the divine energy that once nurtured and maintained the perfect order of Heaven also stopped flowing directly. This loss is like air being withdrawn from the chest, like warmth suddenly leaving in the middle of a cold winter.</p>
                <p>A deadly silence, heavier than before, enveloped the Great Hall. Then, the real collapse began. With no more direct divine energy sustained, the great structures of Heaven began to waver. The sound of shattering sounded from everywhere. The towers of light faded and cracked. The crystal walls, a symbol of eternity, appear countless deeper cracks. The symphony of the heavenly realm is silent, replaced by chaotic, out-of-tune sounds of disintegration and terror.</p>
                <p>The initial fear turned into extreme panic. The angels screamed, scattered in vain, trying to hold on to the last bit of order that was disintegrating like dust.</p>
                <p>Michael roared in despair, the golden sword in his hand was only a faint light. He tried to gather the remaining Archangels: "Hold the ranks! Protect the center! Don't panic!" But his orders were lost in the midst of chaos. His power, which had been nourished by God's light, was now severely weakened. Gabriel stood still, the silver staff in his hand faded, and the golden eyes looking up at the Throne were now just an empty building, filled with despair.</p>
                <p>In the far reaches of the abyss, Lucifer also felt this shocking change—the retreat of the Supreme Light. A half-smile flashed on his lips - the opportunity had come? But then he sensed the widespread instability, the chaos was not limited to Heaven. This retreat means that all old laws are broken. A universe without the direct intervention of the Creator... Was it really the freedom he wanted, or was it an even more terrifying chaos?</p>
                <p>The answer came almost immediately.</p>
                <p>The sky above Heaven was collapsing, and even the Hell above was shaking, suddenly torn apart by an invisible force. A huge space crack, black and deep, opened up like an eye of the universe looking down. It emits neither light nor darkness, only a terrifying, invisible attraction, which begins to pull everything towards it – the glittering fragments of the Heavenly structures, the panicked souls, both the lingering light and the darkness of the abyss.</p>
                <p>Heaven is really disintegrating. And a fateful rain is about to fall.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chapter" id="chapter-2">
                 <h3>Chapter 2: Soul Meteor Shower</h3>
                 <p>The huge space rift above Heaven and Hell is more than just a portal to nothingness. It is an open wound of the universe, an extreme point of imbalance where reality is torn apart, and now, it begins to "bleed" chaotic energy.</p>
                 <p>The terrifying attraction from the crack impacted the energy bodies of the remaining creatures in Heaven that were disintegrating. A storm of primordial energy, frenzy and chaos began to form, swirling around the mouth of the crack like a cosmic whirlwind. This is not the Creator's deliberate wrath, but a natural consequence, a cold rebalancing mechanism of the universe when the core stable energy has receded, leaving a void and a severe imbalance. The universe is trying to "heal" itself with chaos and regeneration.</p>
                 <p>The storm of energy roared from the crack, its sound being the screech of crushed souls, the cracking sound of space-time itself. It swept through the dying Heaven.</p>
                 <p>Not all of them were swept away. Michael, with his iron will and the remaining power, stood in the midst of the storm, trying to protect what was left of Heaven. Lucifer, from his hiding place (possibly Hell), observed the event with cold calculation, not directly affected by this storm.</p>
                 <p>But not everyone is so lucky. Healiangel, the Healer, who had just experienced the trials and transformations of the Veil, perhaps because his being had become more hybrid and more sensitive to chaos, or simply fate, had been caught up in the heart of the storm. Along with him, were a handful of other angels who were probably near the crack, or simply not strong enough to resist the terrible attraction.</p>
                 <p>When caught up in the frenzied energy, the divine essence of Healiangel and the ill-fated angels began to be torn apart. Pure light is blended in, crushed into particles of basic energy. The wings disappeared like ashes. The aura shattered. Most painfully, memories – millennia of existence, knowledge of the universe and ontology – are erased and mercilessly washed away by the chaotic energy. Their characteristic powers, especially Healiangel's healing abilities, are deprived, neutralized, returning to their original latent energy state.</p>
                 <p>It is a "whitewashing" of the soul, a forced and brutal "reset" for those who are caught up.</p>
                 <p>Healiangel felt his being torn apart, the pain of disintegration even greater than when he faced the Broken Veil. His characteristic jade light flashed one last time in despair and then disappeared, leaving only the purest ray of energy, carrying the seeds of compassion, severely damaged, swept into the chaotic flow along with a few other rays of light from the reluctant angels.</p>
                 <p>From the giant crack, these chaotic rays of energy – fragments of the soul that have been bleached, deprived of everything but the most essential essence – begin to shoot out into space like a strange, beautiful but tragic meteor shower. They did not fall into the void, but were pulled back by the gravitational pull of a small, blue planet in the distance.</p>
                 <p>Earth.</p>
                 <p>The Spirit Meteor Shower, carrying Healiangel and a handful of other unknown angels, began to pour down on the peaceful planet, where humanity was still living its finite life, unaware that they were about to receive reluctant visitors, the seeds of a new turbulent era. where the angels who have lost their memory will have to relearn the lesson of being human.</p>
                 <p>These soul entities, after being deprived of their essence and memory, have been reduced to basic and latent forms of energy. They do not dissipate into the void but follow a directional gravitational force, descending on planet Earth. Here, they are expected to begin a new cycle of existence through rebirth, endowed with a physical form and a different life cycle, thereby absorbing essential knowledge and lessons in an environment that is considered harsh and challenging.</p>

            <div class="chapter" id="chapter-3">
                 <h3>Chapter 3: Heaven and Heaven After the Event</h3>
                 <p>The Soul Meteor Shower, a consequence of the cosmic imbalance after God retreated, brought Healiangel and a handful of other angels down to Earth. These souls, bleached in memory and power, begin a new life in strange forms, on strange lands, like seeds waiting to sprout in the "earthly school".</p>
                 <p>The countryside of Vietnam, a rainy night.</p>
                 <p>The wind whistles through the fibrous roof of the small house at the end of the village. Mrs. Lan, a widowed woman with an austere face but her eyes still shining with kindness, is patching up her old shirt under the creeping oil lamp. Her only son died in a flash flood last year, leaving her alone in an empty house. The sound of rain falling on the veranda adds to the loneliness.</p>
                 <p>Suddenly, a strange noise sounded outside the courtyard. It was not the sound of thunder, nor the sound of broken branches. It was like the sound of something soft falling on the moist ground. Curious and a little afraid, Mrs. Lan held an oil lamp and opened the door to look out.</p>
                 <p>In the midst of the rain and darkness, a faint, gentle jade green glow was emanating from an old cloth wrap near the base of the star fruit tree. The light was not dazzling, but extraordinarily warm and pure. Mrs. Lan slowly approached, her heart pounding. She unfolded the fabric.</p>
                 <p>A newborn baby.</p>
                 <p>He was tiny, his skin was pale, and his breath was fragile as if it was about to turn off. But what stunned Ms. Lan was her eyes. Her eyes were wide open, she didn't cry, she wasn't afraid, she just looked at her quietly. A deep, clear, calm jade green color like the surface of a autumn lake, hiding a sadness and wisdom that does not seem to belong to a newborn child. The strange light from earlier seemed to emanate from those same eyes.</p>
                 <p>"Oh my God... Where are you?" Mrs. Lan whispered, her voice trembling. She hurriedly held the baby in her arms, feeling its small, cold body. "Poor child..."</p>
                 <p>She carried the baby into the house, gathered the fire, carefully dried it, and wrapped it in her warmest towel. The baby remained silent, her jade eyes did not leave her.</p>
                 <p>"I'm too weak," Mrs. Lan rubbed while making some diluted rice water. "But you have very beautiful eyes. Well, heaven has brought you to me, I will raise you. I'll call you Hael... Mom's Hael."</p>
                 <p>The child seemed to understand, blinking slightly. The blue light in his eyes faded slightly, as if hidden deep inside. Hael, the reincarnated Healiangel, begins his mortal journey in the arms of a poor but loving mother.</p>
                 <p>London, United Kingdom and Los Angeles, United States.</p>
                 <p>Unlike Hael and the unknown angels who were caught up in the storm, Lucifer was not a victim of the Soul Meteor Shower. The Fallen, after being exiled to Hell, always sought to escape his captivity or influence on the realms. The fact that God receded and the Veil weakened was the golden opportunity he had been waiting for. With his remnant dark powers and inherent cunning, he has found an opening, a way to be present on Earth—not a rebirth of a memory loss, but a deliberate intrusion.</p>
                 <p>He chose the form of a human, recreated his deadly charm, and chose the name Lucifer Morningstar as an arrogant assertion of his being. He was not born into a mundane family, but perhaps used his power to create a perfect cover – a mysterious young master from an ancient family in England, with an unknown source of finance. The broken wing-shaped scar on his back could have been a remnant from an old battle, or a detail he had deliberately retained.</p>
                 <p>And he chose Los Angeles as the stage. The city of temptations, where man displays the most naked desires. He opened Lux, not just for business, but to observe, to manipulate, to find pleasure in the complexity of humanity, and perhaps, to find a new purpose in the absence of God's direct intervention. He remembered who he was, remembered everything that had happened.</p>
                 <p>The confrontation with investor Thompson at Lux is a good example of how he operates in this world.</p>
                 <p>"Mr. Morningstar," he said arrogantly. "I think you should know your location..."</p>
                 <p>Lucifer smiled, his eyes flashing with ancient understanding and power. "You know, Mr. Thompson," he said, his voice weighty. "The interesting thing about Los Angeles is, the location can change very quickly... an offer that cannot be refused."</p>
                 <p>Thompson had a chill down his spine at the piercing gaze and the invisible pressure emanating from Lucifer. It was not the echo of power, but the active use of the power of the Fallen One's essence, even though it was limited to human form.</p>
                 <p>"I... I think we can renegotiate. Uncle... What do you want?"</p>
                 <p>Lucifer was pleased. "See? Everything can be solved with a civilized conversation." He enjoyed this power game. Humans are predictable. But he also felt a curiosity. Will the other "fragments" from Heaven fall here as interesting as he thought? Especially Healiangel?</p>
                 <p>Heaven after the incident.</p>
                 <p>Meanwhile, in Heaven that was slowly cooling, Michael was still standing. He was not swept away, but faced with an even more difficult reality: a Heaven that had lost the direct guidance of its Creator. The throne was empty not because He disappeared, but because He chose to step back and observe.</p>
                 <p>For Michael, who always lived by absolute command and justice, this "silent observing" meant neglect, a test that he believed the remaining weak angels could not overcome. The fear of chaos and outright collapse motivated him to seize power.</p>
                 <p>"Listen!" Michael's voice echoed. "God has stepped back, giving us the right to make our own decisions. But look! That freedom is leading to chaos! He was wrong to trust these weak people! Order must be re-established, by My will, to replace His silence of observation!"</p>
                 <p>He tightened his discipline, turning Heaven into a cold fortress. Anyone who shows weakness or skepticism is punished in the name of "Justice" and "Order." Absolute power, no longer the reflection of God, began to eat away at his soul, turning him into an authoritarian ruler, even though he still believed in his heart that he was doing the right thing to save Heaven. He looked down at Earth with contempt, seeing it as a harbor for the failed and the weak.</p>
                 <p>A new beginning.</p>
                 <p>The two souls that were at the center of the cosmic war are now on Earth, but in two completely different states. Hael embarks on a mortal journey from nothing, with shattered memories and loving instincts. Lucifer, full of consciousness and memory, actively immerses himself in the human world in search of a new purpose or a new pastime. In Heaven, Michael is creating a new order based on fear and power.</p>
                 <p>The three roads have turned out clearly. The "earthly school" opened its doors to Hael and other unknown angels. The Los Angeles stage was ready for Lucifer's performance. And Heaven is entering a new era under Michael's rule. The complex destiny of the three realms has indeed begun.</p>

                 <h3>Chapter 4: The Call of Compassion</h3>
                 <p>Years in the peaceful village passed, and Hael was now a young man of almost twenty years. Although he still had a slender and pale appearance compared to the strong young men in the village, he was no longer as weak as before. Thanks to Mrs. Lan's dedicated care and perhaps partly thanks to the fresh climate, his health has become more stable. Ms. Lan is still healthy, her small grocery store is enough for the mother and daughter to live through the day. Hael often helped his mother look after the shop or followed the village healers to learn about medicinal plants, a job that suited his health and quiet, observant nature.</p>
                 <p>Life seemed to pass peacefully. Hael still kept a certain distance from everyone, still felt that he was a "lodging" in this world, but his love for Mrs. Lan was real, his attachment to this land was real. He was still sensitive to the pain of others, still seeing the invisible "cracks" around the seriously ill or the elderly, but he accepted his helplessness, seeing it as part of a finite human life. The incident with the sparrow in the past was only a vague memory, a strange dream he couldn't explain.</p>
                 <p>Until a fateful afternoon.</p>
                 <p><strong>Vietnamese Village - Unexpected Disaster.</strong></p>
                 <p>That year's rainy season came earlier and was more intense than usual. The water of the Cai River rises and flows rapidly. The rickety bamboo bridge across the river, the only road connecting the village to the outside, has become dangerous. That afternoon, a group of children in the village were playing near the river bank when suddenly, a flash flood came from upstream. The roar of water drowned out the sound of rain. The bamboo bridge shook and collapsed in a muffled scream. The children playing on the bridge were swept away by the fierce flood waters.</p>
                 <p>"Help! Help!" Crying and screaming echoed throughout the river.</p>
                 <p>Villagers rushed to the riverbank, but no one dared to plunge into the rushing water. Hael and Lan also ran out. Looking at the chaotic scene, looking at the small arms reaching in the middle of the murky water, Hael's heart seemed to be suffocated by someone. The familiar helplessness rose again, but this time, it was accompanied by an urge to act more intensely than ever.</p>
                 <p>He saw a little girl, the neighbor Hua who used to play with him, being swept away by the water towards the sharp rocks. Her face was pale with fear, and her faint cry was almost drowned out by the sound of the flood. Next to her, the "crack" of death appeared clearly, black and spreading rapidly.</p>
                 <p>Without further thought, Hael plunged into the water.</p>
                 <p>"Hael! Don't do it!" Mrs. Lan screamed in despair, but it was too late.</p>
                 <p>Hael's weak body was almost instantly swept away by the current. But with an extraordinary will, he still tried to swim towards baby Hoa. The flood water was bitterly cold, swept away by mud, and tree branches hit his body painfully. He felt his strength running out, and his breathing became difficult. But when he saw Baby Hua's desperate gaze, a strange energy suddenly surged from the depths of his chest.</p>
                 <p>He stretched out his hand, trying to grab Hoa's small hand that was reaching out. The moment his hand touched her hand, a brilliant emerald green light, many times stronger than when he saved the sparrow, burst forth from Hael's body. The light formed a faint aura, pushing the roaring flood water away from the two of them in an instant. Baby Hua, who was fainting, suddenly opened her eyes, looking at Hael in amazement. The bruises on her body from the impact seemed to fade.</p>
                 <p>But Hael didn't feel it. He only felt a pain tearing through his heart as if his soul had been withdrawn, and all his strength was gone. His mind was spinning, his eyes darkened. Before he fainted, he only had time to push baby Hoa to the shore with all his strength, where the villagers had time to use bamboo poles to pull her up. Then he fainted, swept away by the floodwaters.</p>
                 <p>When Hael woke up, he found himself lying in a familiar house, surrounded by Mrs. Lan and the villagers, worried. He was only slightly bruised and exhausted, luckily pushed by the water to the shore and rescued in time. Baby Hoa is also safe. But the memory of the blue light, the feeling of energy surging and then disappearing, about the pain of tearing the intestines and liver became vague, flickering like a dream. He only remembered that he had rushed down to save people and then fainted.</p>
                 <p>"I'm awake! Thank you, Buddha!" Mrs. Lan hugged him tightly, sobbing. "You're too risky, Hael! You can't be like that next time, right?"</p>
                 <p>Hael just kept silent, looking out the window. He felt scared. Fear of the floodwaters, fear of death, and fear of yourself. Something wasn't right going on inside him, a power he didn't understand and couldn't control.</p>
                 <p><strong>Heaven - absolute power.</strong></p>
                 <p>At the same time, in the cold Heaven, Michael was standing in front of the remaining angels. He has just issued a new law: any expression of excessive emotion, any skepticism about the new order will be considered treason and severely punished.</p>
                 <p>A low-level angel, looking tired, timidly spoke up: "Archangel General, whether... Should we be more concerned about the souls who have fallen to Earth? They used to be our brothers..."</p>
                 <p>Michael turned around, his eyes as cold as ice. The golden sword at his side shook slightly. "Brothers? The weak and the failed are not my brothers! The Earth is a place of chaos, a failed lesson of freedom. It is our duty to protect this remnant purity of Heaven, at all costs! Discipline is power! Order is Justice! Whoever mentions those mortals or fallen souls will be subject to My judgment!"</p>
                 <p>The angels bowed their heads silently, not daring to look directly at Michael. The atmosphere became even heavier and suffocating. Absolute power is turning Michael into the very thing he fought against.</p>
                 <p><strong>Los Angeles - The hunt begins.</strong></p>
                 <p>In his lavish penthouse overlooking Los Angeles, Lucifer was reviewing reports from a network of henchmen around the world. He glanced at information about politics, economics, war... are all boring and predictable.</p>
                 <p>"Isn't it interesting?" He asked the assistant who was waiting for orders.</p>
                 <p>"Sir, there have been a few reports of anomalous energy phenomena in some remote areas, and some cases of ordinary people suddenly possessing strange abilities after 'dying and coming back to life' or having an accident..."</p>
                 <p>Lucifer raised his eyebrows, and a smile of interest appeared. "Oh? Abnormal energy? Strange possibilities? It seems that the 'rain' of the past has left some interesting 'seeds'." He stood up and walked towards the large window. "Focus on those reports. Especially places with signs of... pure light. Find us those special individuals. Maybe this 'earthly school' is going to have some more interesting lessons."</p>
                 <p>His eyes flashed with calculation. Life in LA is starting to get boring, it's time to stir things up a bit. And finding fallen angels, especially Healiangel, seems like a good start.</p>
                 <p><strong>Change.</strong></p>
                 <p>On Earth, Hael was trembling at the latent power that had just burst out. In Los Angeles, Lucifer began the hunt. In Heaven, Michael squeezed power. Three fates, three worlds, although separate, but the invisible thread of destiny has begun to tighten...</p>

            <div class="chapter" id="chapter-5">
                 <h3>Chapter 5: Between the Flow of People and the Hidden Corners of the Soul</h3>
                 <p>The terrible incident on the bank of the Cai River that year left an indelible scar on Hael's soul. He saves little Hoa, but the price is extreme exhaustion and an obsession with the mysterious jade green light, the moment he touches the boundary between life and death. He was afraid of himself, afraid of the uncontrollable energy that was sleeping somewhere inside. The feeling of being lost and different from the villagers became even more profound. They looked at him with eyes that were both admiring and apprehensive after that incident. Unable to face the gazes and unanswered questions, as well as to escape his own confusion, Hael decided to leave the village when he was just an adult. He went to the city, immersed himself in the flow of unknown people, hoping that the noise and bustle of the city would help him forget or at least overshadow the scary mysteries about himself.</p>
                 <p><strong>In the middle of the flow of people - daytime masks:</strong></p>
                 <p>Hael chooses jobs in the hospitality industry – hotel receptionists, restaurant waiters, bus ticket salesmen – where he can come into contact with hundreds of faces a day but doesn't need to connect deeply with anyone. That's how he sees the human world. learn about their complex emotions, while keeping a safe distance. He still kept a calm appearance, his jade eyes were calm but there was an extraordinary empathy. The ability to see the "cracks" in others is still there, as a constant reminder of the fragility of human life and your own helplessness.</p>
                 <p>Mr. Nam, the manager of the hotel where Hael worked the longest, often shook his head at his special employee. "This little Hael is good-natured, hardworking, but he's like a man in the clouds," he told his wife. "Working hard all day, but the nose is always worried, and it's even good to give money to poor customers. I don't know what he thinks."</p>
                 <p>Mai, the receptionist colleague, was more straightforward. "Brother Hael, tell me the truth, you just live in a closed house forever and don't feel lonely? Sometimes you have to open your heart!"</p>
                 <p>Hael just laughed. He knew they cared, but how could he explain how he felt like an "innkeeper", about the shattered images that came back from time to time, about the terrifying energy he felt every time his emotions ran high? He was afraid of scaring them, afraid of being seen as crazy. Therefore, he chose to be silent, putting on the mask of a gentle, quiet boy.</p>
                 <p><strong>Hidden Corners of the Soul - Seeking Artificial Liberation:</strong></p>
                 <p>But that mask becomes too cramped at night. The boredom of repetitive work, the pressure of hiding oneself, the feeling of being lost in a sea of people, and a vague fear of oneself pushed Hael to find other "escapes". He plunged into the all-night fun like a burner, not out of real desire, but out of a desperate need to feel something different, to touch limits, or simply to temporarily forget who he really was.</p>
                 <p>He could sit idly in a noisy casino, looking at the dancing numbers, feeling the fake thrill of those who were betting their fortunes. He could take part in dangerous street car races, feeling the wind whistling in his ears, speed, and death just around the corner. He could sit in a casual bar, drinking wine like plain water—the high-altitude alcohol of humans seemed to be unable to touch his special body. He was always the "False Saint", the most sober among his drunken friends, quietly watching them laugh and talk, cry, quarrel with a cold indifference.</p>
                 <p>"Why are you never drunk, Hael?" A drinking friend asked softly, putting his arm around his shoulder. "It's always like that stone statue, bored to death!"</p>
                 <p>Hael only took one more sip of wine, the bitterness did not make him drunk, only made the feeling of emptiness inside more pronounced. Are you trying to fit in, or are you punishing yourself? He didn't know.</p>
                 <p>Once, after a late-night car race, a friend in the group unfortunately had a serious accident, his limbs were scratched, and he was bleeding a lot. Everyone panicked. Hael, instinctively, was the first to run over. He helped his friend up, his hand unconsciously touching the largest wound that was bleeding. A familiar feeling, a slight warmth spread from his hand. He hurriedly withdrew his hand, frightened.</p>
                 <p>The next morning, the friend woke up in the hospital, surprised to find that his wound was dry and the pain was unbelievably relieved. He tried to remember what had happened last night, but the image of Hael at that time became very vague. "Hael... it did something strange... but... I don't remember it well," he told others.</p>
                 <p>And Hael, after that night, felt his tired body disintegrate, and the memory of Lan's mother's smile seemed to fade a little more. The cost of using latent energy, however unconscious, is becoming more and more obvious and frightening. The more he tried to run away from himself, the more he was held back by it.</p>
                 <p><strong>Heaven & Los Angeles – Parallel Moves.</strong></p>
                 <p>In Heaven, Michael received a report of unusual energy fluctuations on Earth, but he brushed it off. "It's just the chaos of mortals and fallen ones. Not worth worrying about. Focus on internal purification!" He ordered Gabriel and Uriel to watch more closely than the rest of the angels.</p>
                 <p>In Los Angeles, Lucifer receives more detailed reports about Hael, including rumors about him never getting drunk and strange "healings" happening around him. "Interesting," Lucifer smirked. "There is both the compassion of a saint and the self-destructive behavior of a sinner. Healiangel, you've changed a lot. Or perhaps, you're trying to find yourself again in a very... people." He decided to speed up the approach plan. "Prepare the plane. I think it's time for a business trip to Southeast Asia."</p>
                 <p>His eyes flashed with calculation. Life in LA is starting to get boring, it's time to stir things up a bit. And finding fallen angels, especially Healiangel, seems like a good start.</p>
                 <p><strong>Lost.</strong></p>
                 <p>Hael stood alone on the rooftop of the hotel after his shift, looking down at the noisy traffic below. He felt more lost than ever. During the day, he is a dedicated servant, trying to ease the pain of mortality. At night, he is a reckless seeker of oblivion in dangerous amusements. Who are you between those two people? The jade-green light that flashed from time to time in his subconscious and the eyes of the people he helped me, what did it mean? He didn't know. He only felt the burden getting bigger and bigger, and a vague premonition that this false peaceful life was coming to an end.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chapter" id="chapter-6">
                <h3>Chapter 6: The Shadow of Charity</h3>
                <p>Hael's life continues in persistent contradictions. During the day, he is a dedicated service boy, trying to soothe the pain of mortality with small gestures, even though his heart always feels helpless before the invisible "cracks" he sees. At night, he is a lost person who seeks oblivion in dangerous pleasures, only to wake up with a tired body and an increasingly empty mind, the memories of Lan's mother or the strange blue light fade a little. He seemed to be trapped between two worlds, not belonging to any place at all.</p>
                <p><strong>Unexpected appearance.</strong></p>
                <p>On a weekend morning, when Hael was helping Mr. Nam take inventory of the books at the hotel front desk, a jet black limousine, so luxurious that it was lost, quietly parked in front of the door. All eyes in the small hall were focused on the car. The car door opened, and Lucifer Morningstar stepped down. Still a branded suit without a single wrinkle, meticulously groomed black hair, and a half-smile full of charm but hidden something unpredictable. His temperament radiated a strong attraction, making the people around him unconsciously hold their breath.</p>
                <p>He was not accompanied by a bodyguard, only an assistant dressed in polite business clothes followed. Lucifer rolled his eyes around the hotel lobby, his gaze stopping exactly where Hael was standing, even though he was trying to cower behind the counter.</p>
                <p>"Good morning," Lucifer said, his deep English voice sounding clearly in the midst of an unusually quiet space. "Can I meet Mr. Hael?"</p>
                <p>Mr. Nam hurriedly walked out, somewhat confused. "Yes... Yes, sir. This is Hael." He pushed Hael forward slightly.</p>
                <p>Hael looked up, facing the mysterious man. Lucifer's deep black eyes stared at him intently, not missing a single detail—from his slender physique, pale skin, to his distinctive jade-colored eyes gleaming with surprise and vigilance.</p>
                <p>"Nice to meet you, Hael," Lucifer smiled, holding out his hand. "I'm Lucifer Morningstar. I've heard a lot about you."</p>
                <p>Hael shook his hand hesitantly, feeling a slight electric current and an indescribable cold sensation from that perfect hand. "You... are you looking for me?"</p>
                <p>"That's right," Lucifer nodded, retracting his hand naturally. "I happened to know the story of your kindness and bravery, especially during the flash flood a few years ago. I really admire young people like you who dare to act for others."</p>
                <p>He said sincerely, but his eyes flashed with cold calculation as he observed Hael's reaction. "It's still that look," he thought to himself. "Healiangel's eyes, filled with compassion but also full of innocence. It's perfect to get started."</p>
                <p>"I run a charity," Lucifer continued, his tone becoming more intimate. "And we are looking for projects and individuals who deserve to support in this area. When I heard about you and the community here, I thought I should come and see it myself."</p>
                <p>He gestured to the assistant. The assistant immediately placed a thick document on the counter.</p>
                <p>"This is our proposal," Lucifer said. "The Morningstar Foundation wants to fund a significant amount of money to upgrade the facilities of this hotel, where he works, as well as to support part of the medical expenses for the elderly who are lonely in his village. And for you, Hael, we want to give you a full scholarship, so that you can pursue any discipline you want, to reach your full potential."</p>
                <p>The offer was like a bomb exploding in the middle of the hotel lobby. Mr. Nam opened his mouth, speechless. Mai, the receptionist, who was standing nearby, was also stunned. Helping the whole hotel, the villagers, and a full scholarship for Hael? This is too good to be true.</p>
                <p>Hael was the most confused. He looked at the documentary, and then looked at the man in front of him. This generosity is too great, too sudden. His instinct told him that something was wrong, but reason was tempted. He thought of Lan's mother, to the villagers who were struggling, to the patients he helplessly watched them suffer. This opportunity can change everything.</p>
                <p>"Why... Why are you so good to me and everyone?" Hael asked again, his voice trembling, trying to find the truth in those black eyes.</p>
                <p>Lucifer laughed softly, a smile that made it easy to believe. "Why? Because I like to do good, Hael. And because, as I said, I see in you a special potential, an unusual light. I want to help that light shine. It's that simple." He leaned forward slightly, lowering his voice. "Think about this offer. There is no need to rush to answer. My people will get back to you."</p>
                <p>Saying that, Lucifer turned around and leisurely stepped out of the waiting car, leaving Hael, Mr. Nam, Mai and the entire hotel lobby in surprise and a chaotic atmosphere.</p>
                <p><strong>Heaven - Surveillance Order.</strong></p>
                <p>Michael receives a report from Uriel about Lucifer's unusual presence and philanthropy in a remote countryside in Vietnam, near where a strange energy oscillation was previously recorded.</p>
                <p>"What is he playing?" Michael frowned. "Charity? The Fallen One does charity?" He didn't believe in Lucifer's kindness, but he didn't understand his purpose either. "Keep an eye on him. And that area too. If there is any indication that he is trying to interfere with the 'lesson' of the fallen souls, report it to Me immediately. I will not allow him to break the fragile order on Earth, even though He has chosen to stand out." He still despised what was happening on earth, but Lucifer's arrival made him wary.</p>
                <p><strong>Los Angeles - With Mồi.</strong></p>
                <p>Sitting on a private plane back to LA, Lucifer smiled contentedly. The play was a great success. Hael took a bite. His innocence, compassion, and difficult circumstances were perfect weaknesses.</p>
                <p>"The observation phase is over," he thought. "Now is the time to approach and 'nurture' that potential. See where your limits are, Healiangel. See if your kindness can be bent into something... more interesting than not." He ordered his network to begin implementing "philanthropic" activities in Vietnam, while also seeking to bring Hael closer to him, be it an offer to work at one of his charities, or an opportunity to study abroad. The prey was in sight.</p>
                <p><strong>Confusion.</strong></p>
                <p>Hael held the Morningstar Foundation's proposal in his hand, his heart heavy. The opportunity to change his life was right in front of him, not only for him but also for the people he loved. But the uneasy hunch about the man named Lucifer Morningstar has not disappeared. What choice do you have to make? Accept this "shadow of charity", or continue with your lost but peaceful life? This decision is even more difficult than facing flood waters every year.</p>

            <div class="chapter" id="chapter-7">
                 <h3>Chapter 7: Choice in the Night</h3>
                 <p>Night fell. The sound of rain falling evenly tapped the dull rhythm on the corrugated iron roof of the hostel. In the small, damp room, the golden light surged Hael's shadow on the patchy wall. He sat motionless, his intricate jade-colored eyes staring at the thick pile of documents on the table—the flashy proposal from the Morningstar Foundation. An utopian "treasure" in the middle of the mortal world, a promise of life that he had never dared to dream of, lying there, both inviting and burning.</p>
                 <p>Hael's mind whirled between hope and doubt. The image of Lan's mother with thin shoulders, a gentle smile but deep traces of time. The money could not only rebuild the roof and buy tonics, but also bring her the peace of old age. Then the children in the shelter, the lonely old people in the village with the invisible "cracks" of disease and despair that he could only helplessly see. This offer was a golden opportunity for him to really make a difference, so that the deep compassion within him would no longer be an empty torment. An opportunity to escape from the confines of life, to learn, to explore the world, and perhaps, to discover yourself. A glimmer of excitement, a feeling of being empowered to change the fate of not only his own but also the people he cares about.</p>
                 <p>But immediately, a stream of cold air ran down his spine. Lucifer Morningstar. The half-mouth smile was full of implications, and the abyss-like black eyes seemed to see through every hidden corner. This generosity came too easily. Does a "treasure" come with an exorbitant price? A hunch told him that this was a dangerous game, a delicious bait impregnated with a sophisticated poison.</p>
                 <p>Memories suddenly rushed back, intertwined between strength and fear:</p>
                 <p>The jade-green light blazed violently around him and Little Hoa in the middle of the flood water – a strange power.</p>
                 <p>The body disintegrates when he wakes up, the memory of the light is vague like a dream—the price of that power.</p>
                 <p>The feeling of emptiness to the extreme in the midst of the noisy silver – the escape from the essence.</p>
                 <p>The flow of warmth faded when she touched her friend's wound, in exchange for fatigue and a cold void in her memory of her mother—the accompanying loss.</p>
                 <p>Hael shuddered. Accepting this offer meant getting closer to the power that both blessed and cursed within him. Will he be able to control it, or will he be swallowed up by it, taken advantage of for dark purposes? The feeling of "innkeeper" rises again. But this time, it comes with another question: if you're already a boarder, why not choose a better place to live, one where you can actually do something meaningful, even if it's only temporarily? The temptation of opportunity is too great.</p>
                 <p>He picked up the phone and called Lan's mother. Her voice on the other end of the line, amid the sound of pouring rain, was still unusually warm. "Son," she said after listening to him, her voice lowering, "I know you've always wanted to help people. Such a good opportunity is indeed rare. But Hael, kindness without wisdom is easily exploited. That man... I already felt uneasy when I heard you. You have to think carefully, don't be greedy for immediate benefits." His mother's advice was both a fulcrum and a deep swirl of contradictions in Hael's heart.</p>
                 <p><strong>Heaven.</strong></p>
                 <p>The Great Hall of Light was cold and desolate. Michael stood on the steps of the makeshift throne, his cold eyes watching the army of angels move with mechanical discipline. The general light is weak, just enough to clearly illuminate the cracks that are spreading on the crystal walls. Uriel approached, his face calm. "Governor, there is a report from Earth. Lucifer Morningstar approached Healiangel. He made an offer of funding and scholarships." Michael smirked, a scornful smile. "Healiangel? Who has been swept away in a storm of chaos because of his own weakness?" His voice echoed, cold. "Has he accepted the Fallen One's almsgiving?" "There is no final decision yet, Mr. President." "Hmm," Michael turned away. "A healing angel is confused by the trivial material temptations of mankind. It's disappointing! He is no longer worthy of our attention. Let him decide his own lowly fate in that 'earthly school'." His eyes were hard, without a hint of sympathy. "Focus on maintaining order here!" Gabriel stood not far away, silently bowing his head, his silver wings trembling slightly. He heard the scorn in Michael's voice. A vague fear rose for the fate of his old brother on earth, but he did not dare to speak up. Heaven now has no room for compassion.</p>
                 <p><strong>Return to Hael's motel room.</strong></p>
                 <p>The sound of the rain had stopped. Hael stood up, walked to the window overlooking the dark alley. The decision took shape, a complex choice between a desire for change, the appeal of opportunity, and a vague fear of the cost. He picked up the phone again and called Lucifer's assistant. His voice was even, trying to hide the chaos inside. "I accept the offer," he said, word for word as a deliberate compromise. "But I have the conditions..." He made a request to choose his own school and was allowed to return to visit the village, a last-ditch effort to retain some autonomy, to show that he was not completely passive in entering the game. On the other end of the line, a professional voice rang out, agreeing with suspiciously ease.</p>
                 <p>The call ends. Hael let go of the phone, leaning against the cold wall. He chose. The door to an uncertain future has opened, bringing with it both the light of opportunity and the darkness of danger. He knew that he had just set his first foot on a path that could not turn back. A deep sense of insecurity enveloped him, but this time, there was a faint glimmer of hope for change.</p>

            <div class="chapter" id="chapter-8">
                 <h3>Chapter 8: Entering the New World</h3>
                 <p>The day Hael left, the sky was not raining, but it was heavy with a lead gray. The farewell took place quietly in front of the dilapidated house. Mrs. Lan didn't cry much, only her eyes were red, and her thin hands trembled to stroke the folds of Hael's worn shirt. She put in his hand the last piece of thorn leaf cake, the gift of the countryside that he still loved. "Take the road to stay healthy, baby," she choked up. "Don't forget your mother, don't forget this village." Hael hugged her mother's thin shoulders tightly, trying to inhale the familiar scent, trying to engrave this image in her mind, an invisible fear that this warm memory would eventually fade like smoke. He couldn't say a word, just nodded, his throat choked bitterly. He promised to call often, to visit as soon as he could, but deep down in his heart, he clearly felt that an invisible distance was growing, not just geography. Turning his back and walking, he didn't dare to look back, afraid that he wouldn't have the courage to leave the only embrace that really belonged to him.</p>
                 <p>The luxury car sent by the people of the Morningstar Foundation took Hael straight to a high-end apartment complex in the center of magnificent Saigon. Far from a damp motel room or a simple cottage, his new residence is a modern, comfortable serviced apartment with large glass doors overlooking the bustling city. Hael stands in the middle of a spacious living room, between shiny surfaces and expensive furniture. A part of him, who was too accustomed to deprivation, couldn't help but be overwhelmed by this sudden luxury. The opportunity to study, a better life, a "treasure" that he had never dared to dream of, was now unfolding in front of him. But the bright crystal light exuded a cold feeling, and the sterile perfection of this place made him feel strange. The feeling of "innkeeper" quickly returned, more intense. This is not home. This is a gorgeous, gilded cage, but it's still a cage.</p>
                 <p>The people of the Morningstar Foundation, who always appear with standard smiles and polite business attire, help him arrange his new life. They signed him up for crash English classes, gave him instructions on how to use modern equipment, and took him shopping for some new clothes — things he had never thought of before. They give him a chance with both hands, but their smiles never seem to reach the bottom of his eyes. Hael felt the implicit surveillance behind that almost perfect thoughtful cover. They knew exactly when he left the house, when he came back. Once, an employee even accidentally mentioned details in a private conversation between him and Lan's mother over the phone, making Hael's spine cold. He caught a glimpse of the familiar black car that had taken him from the countryside to the bottom of the building a few times, and then quickly merged into the traffic.</p>
                 <p>In order to "help Hael integrate and gain experience", the Foundation arranged for him to work part-time at their representative office. The work is not strenuous, mainly handling paperwork, interpreting simple documents, and sometimes accompanying other employees on field trips to funded projects.</p>
                 <p>During a trip to visit a loving home for orphans in the suburbs, Hael once again faces the earthly pain that he is both afraid and compelled to touch. In the midst of the innocent children, he noticed a thin girl sitting alone in the corner of the yard, her big round eyes looking into the distance. A faint "crack", a sign of deep hurt, existed around her, as if it was gently vibrating, inviting healing. Compassion is like an electric current running through Hael's body. He wanted to walk over, he wanted to put his hand on those trembling little shoulders, he wanted to soothe the pain in those eyes. The instinct screamed inside him.</p>
                 <p>But then the image of the Rolling Cai River, the feeling of exhaustion fades, and the fear of shattered memories comes back as a cold warning. His hands clenched, his nails pressed deep into his palms to the point of blood. You can't! You don't dare! The price was too high - the very pieces of memories of his mother, the only warmth he ever knew. He could only quietly approach, sit down next to her, and clumsily hand her the last sugar candy left in his pocket. She looked up at him, her eyes still gloomy but a little more surprised. Helplessness and self-reproach were like a rock weighing down Hael's chest. He turned away, not daring to look directly into those clear eyes anymore.</p>
                 <p><strong>Los Angeles.</strong></p>
                 <p>In a luxurious office on the top floor of the Lux building, Lucifer smiled contentedly as he looked at the report and the photos sent back from Vietnam. Especially the moment when Hael struggles internally and decides not to touch the orphan. The large screen in front of him showed Hael sitting alone in the apartment, his face hidden in darkness. "Great," he whispered, twirling the whiskey glass in his hand. "The fear has begun to take root. Let compassion and helplessness torment him. When a healing angel does not dare to heal, he will begin to doubt his own being. And that's when I can reshape him at will." He took a sip of wine, his eyes flashing with the excitement of the hunter who was cornering his prey into the corner of the wall.</p>
                 <p><strong>Heaven.</strong></p>
                 <p>Michael's eyes were still watching the angel armies who were practicing non-stop in the Great Hall. The sound of metal colliding with each other was dry and cold. Reports of Hael's repression in the home of love only add to his contempt. "Weakness and fear. He had completely lost his angelic nature. There's nothing worth worrying about." Gabriel stood behind him, and hearing that cold comment, his heart sank. He looked down at the distant Earth, where his old brother was struggling alone in the dark, targeted by both Heaven and Hell. But he could only sigh in silence, his silver wings drooping helplessly.</p>
                 <p>Night fell again. Hael sits alone in a lavish but unusually empty apartment. The city lights outside were bright, promising many things, but they could not illuminate the loneliness and confusion in his heart. He had entered a new world, seized a chance to change his life, but the feeling of being lost and imprisoned was even more pronounced. The road ahead was blurry, full of invisible pitfalls under a flashy cover, and he didn't know if he had the strength, or rather the courage, to face it. He looked at his hands, wondering if they still had the ability to bring healing, or if there was only a trembling of fear left.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chapter" id="chapter-9">
                 <h3>Chapter 9: First Lessons</h3>
                 <p>Hael's new life gradually entered the reels. The initial overwhelm at material comforts and open opportunities subsided, giving way to a more sophisticated sense of emptiness. The high-end apartment is still unfamiliar, and the work at the Morningstar Foundation, although not hard, makes him feel suffocated by the cold professionalism and the feeling of being constantly monitored. The calls to Lan's mother became less and less frequent, not because he had forgotten, but because the distance between the two worlds was getting bigger and bigger, and the confidants became difficult to say.</p>
                 <p>The work at the office brought Hael more exposure to the Foundation's "charity" activities. He is tasked with helping screen applications for help, participating in partner meet-ups and sometimes flashy fundraising events. Lucifer seemed to want him to see the "true face" of the world he was manipulating.</p>
                 <p>At a fundraiser held at one of the city's most luxurious hotels, Hael, dressed in a suit prepared by the Foundation, felt out of place among the lavishly dressed elite crowd. They laughed, toasted, pledged great donations to the less fortunate, but their eyes were full of calculation, conversations revolving more about business than true compassion. He found the Foundation's project manager tactfully rejecting a difficult case that did not bring media benefits, while prioritizing another project that could polish the name of the major donor. The naked fake made Hael feel nauseous. It was far from the simple, sincere kindness he had known back home.</p>
                 <p>He quietly retreated to the balcony, looking down at the brightly lit city. The cold indifference he had tried to maintain in self-defense seemed to be validated by this world. Is kindness just a luxury, a tool for exchanging benefits? That thought made him both bitter and a little bit... strangely relieved. If the world works like this, then your disorientation, your separation, may not be completely meaningless.</p>
                 <p><strong>Heaven.</strong></p>
                 <p>In a corner where the little bit of the warm light of Heaven was slowly cooling, near where the Curtain was still smoldering faint cracks, Gabriel stood silent, his eyes looking at the Earth. His golden wings drooped, no longer as glorious as before. Beside him, Uriel, the Archangel of Wisdom, with an unpredictable calm face, was also contemplating. "Can you feel it, Uriel?" Gabriel asked softly, his voice full of worry. "Lucifer's influence is spreading around Healiangel. He's being dragged into a spiral of falsehood and skepticism." Uriel nodded slowly, his deep eyes staring into the void. "I see. The Fallen is doing his lesson in his own way. He wanted to prove that even the purest soul could be tainted by the material world and the complexity of the human race." "We can't stand and watch!" Gabriel was frustrated. "Michael... He was so focused on order that he forgot compassion. He sees Healiangel as a failure, but I believe he still has the light inside!" "Your compassion is precious, Gabriel," Uriel replied, his voice even but containing ancient wisdom. "But don't forget, this is an 'earthly school'. Each soul must face the challenge on its own, find the way on its own. Our intervention now could break the lesson Healiangel needs to learn. Even the Creator has chosen to step back and observe." Gabriel clenched the silver staff in his hand, his gaze still not leaving the blurry image of the Earth. He knew that Uriel was right, but the messenger's heart was still heavy with worry for the brother who was fighting alone down there.</p>
                 <p>Michael, looking down at the exchange between the two Generals from above, only smirked slightly and then turned away, continuing to supervise the steel discipline of the angel army. To him, Gabriel's weakness and skepticism were just as despicable as Healiangel's fall.</p>
                 <p>Returning to the apartment after the party, Hael felt tired, disintegrated, not because of work, but because of the chaotic emotions inside. He sat by the window, watching that the rain had started to fall again. Suddenly, an image flashed through his mind—not clear, just an unusually warm feeling spreading from his chest, a soft blue light, and the pure laughter of Lan's mother a long time ago, when he was a weak child held in her arms. The fragile memory flashed and faded, leaving him with a vague regret and longing for a lost purity.</p>
                 <p>At that moment, his phone rang. A message from an unknown number, but sent through the Morningstar Foundation's internal system. "Hi Hael, I'm in charge of your scholarship program. Mr. Morningstar is very impressed with his progress and would like to invite him to Los Angeles in the near future to discuss his study plans and visit the Foundation's headquarters. All expenses will be covered. Please let us know your convenience."</p>
                 <p>Hael read the message over and over again, his heart pounding. Los Angeles. Head office. Meet Lucifer Morningstar. The Fallen One's invisible hand was outstretched, pulling him closer. He knew this was a dangerous turn, but at the same time, an irresistible curiosity also arose. Is it time to face the person behind it all?</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chapter" id="chapter-10">
                 <h3>Chapter 10: The Trip to Los Angeles</h3>
                 <p>After several days of inner struggle, between irresistible curiosity and vague insecurity, Hael decided to accept the invitation to Los Angeles. He told himself that this was an opportunity to better understand the Morningstar Foundation, his academic plans, and more importantly, to face, if only indirectly, the mysterious man who was slowly dominating his life. The last call to Lan's mother was brief, he only said that he had an important business trip related to the scholarship, trying to hide the real destination and anxiety in his voice.</p>
                 <p>The long flight across the Pacific Ocean was a completely new experience for Hael. Sitting in the comfortable business class cabin arranged by the Foundation, he looked through the small window and saw the ground and the clouds receding behind him. It feels like you're floating in mid-air, detached from everything familiar. An ancient soul trapped in a modern machine, flying towards an uncertain future. He closed his eyes, trying to find peace, but his mind was invaded by disjointed images: the faint blue light, the sad eyes of an orphan, Lucifer's half-smile, and Michael's contemptuous gaze from distant Heaven. He was crossing a line, not just the ocean, but also the boundary between the old world and a much more dangerous game.</p>
                 <p>Los Angeles welcomed Hael with a culture shock and an overwhelming feeling. The noisy atmosphere, endless traffic, skyscrapers sparkling in the scorching California sun, are completely different from the peace of the countryside or the hustle and bustle of life, but still somewhat close to Saigon. Everything is too big, too fast, too flashy. The energy of this city is intense, complex, both vibrant and contains something chaotic, making Hael feel even more small and lost.</p>
                 <p>A woman with bright red hair, dressed elegantly and wearing sunglasses that covered most of her face, waited for him at the airport with a sign that read "Hael - Morningstar Charity". She introduced herself as Evelyn, who would support him throughout her stay in LA. Evelyn's voice was sweet but somewhat mechanical, and her smile was professional but not warm. She led Hael to the waiting luxury sedan, and the car quickly merged into the heavy traffic.</p>
                 <p>Hael was taken to a super-luxury hotel in Beverly Hills, where the Foundation had booked a spacious suite with sweeping views of the city. The absurd extravagance of this place once again made him feel uncomfortable. Evelyn gave him a tentative schedule: rest, a meeting with the scholarship manager tomorrow, and then a tour of the Foundation's headquarters. "Mr. Morningstar has some unexpected business right now," Evelyn announced with an old smile, "but he'll arrange a time to see you soon."</p>
                 <p><strong>Heaven.</strong></p>
                 <p>Gabriel and Uriel watched as Hael entered a luxury hotel in Los Angeles through a dim mist of light. "He's there," Gabriel whispered, his voice full of anxiety. "The City of the Fallen Angels, the center of Lucifer's power. Evelyn... She is one of his closest people, a soul that has been completely swallowed up by darkness." "I know," Uriel replied, his eyes still calm but deeper. "Lucifer wants to test Healiangel's limits, wants to push him between temptation and power. He wants to see if the healing essence can be bent into a tool of manipulation." "We have to do something!" Gabriel turned to Uriel, helplessness evident on his face. "Michael... He was so focused on order that he forgot compassion. He sees Healiangel as a failure, but I believe he still has the light inside!" "Patience, Gabriel," Uriel placed his hand on his brother's shoulder. "Observe. Don't underestimate the hidden power within Healiangel, even if he no longer remembers who he is. Light can glimmer in the darkest places. This lesson, however harsh, is necessary."</p>
                 <p>Michael, in the Great Hall, is reviewing reports of energy drops in some of the lower heavens. He dismissed the information about Hael's arrival in LA that a subordinate angel had just reported. "Trivia of the world! Report on the defensive situation on the eastern border!" The survival of the Heavenly order was his only concern.</p>
                 <p>First night in Los Angeles. Hael stood by the suite's huge glass window, looking down at the sea of light that stretched to the horizon. This city is dangerously beautiful, charming but full of pitfalls. He felt the presence of Lucifer envelop the place, an ancient, powerful and dark energy, even though he had never appeared. The initial curiosity is now tinged with obvious fear. He felt like a pawn had just been placed on the chessboard of a space game that he didn't understand the rules of the game well. Suddenly, a sharp pain flashed through his temples, and the image of a huge, brilliant but shattering pair of white wings flashed through his mind as fast as lightning, leaving behind a deep and incomprehensible sense of loss. He put his hand up to his head, trying to hold on to that image, but it was gone, leaving only the echo of the sleepless city out there.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chapter" id="chapter-11">
                 <h3>Chapter 11: The First Encounters</h3>
                 <p>After a night of flinching between luxury and insecurity, Hael is escorted by Evelyn to meet the person in charge of the scholarship program. The offices of the Morningstar Foundation occupy an entire floor in a modern glass building in the heart of Los Angeles. Minimalist yet luxurious interiors, transparent glass walls overlooking the vibrant city below, all exude power and wealth.</p>
                 <p>The person in charge is a middle-aged man named Davies, with an expensive suit and a polite smile. He greeted Hael very warmly, asking about the flight, about his first impression of Los Angeles. The conversation seemed friendly at first, but Hael sensed Davies' keen gaze analyzing him, examining every gesture and every word. "So, Hael," Davies began to get to the point, flipping through a thin file (which Hael was sure wasn't provided by you), "we're impressed with your potential. Mr. Morningstar believes he can contribute a lot to the world. Do you have any orientation about the major you want to pursue? Medicine? Social work? Areas where you can promote your special compassion?"</p>
                 <p>Compassion. From there, he touched a deep corner in Hael. He thought about the "cracks", so helpless that he couldn't ease the pain of others. A thought flashed, a vague desire to learn about the human body, about life and death, about true healing. He opened his mouth, intending to talk about medicine, about desire...</p>
                 <p>But suddenly, a thick and cold fog enveloped his mind. The thoughts that have just been formed suddenly become fragmented and meaningless. His throat was dry, and his words were choked. He stammered, trying to express himself, but only made hesitant and incoherent sounds. A sense of inferiority and confusion invades. Why do you want to study medicine? Do you have that ability? Who are you to dare to think about healing others?</p>
                 <p><strong>Heaven.</strong></p>
                 <p>Michael stood in the Great Hall, his eyes coldly looking at the dim ball of light that was displaying the scene in Davies' office. He did not directly take action, but a silent order was transmitted. A low-level angel under his rule, Raguel, the angel of justice (according to Michael's distorted interpretation), exerted an infinitesimal flow of energy, enough to amplify Hael's inferiority complex and pre-existing psychological trauma in human form, causing his mind to be confused at the decisive moment. "Justice requires the weak to recognize their place," Michael thought to himself. "It's impossible for Lucifer to easily acquire a powerful tool."</p>
                 <p>Davies frowned at Hael who was confused, his polite smile slightly faded. He made a note on the file. "Looks like you need more time to think," Davies said, his voice still professional but losing his original warmth. "It's okay. We'll discuss it in more detail later."</p>
                 <p>The tour of the Foundation's headquarters was no better. Hael walked through the rows of modern offices, looking at the well-dressed employees working with nervous expressions. Everything is artificially perfect. When he saw a report on the effectiveness of a medical assistance project in a remote area, with a keen intuition that remained, Hael recognized some conflicting figures, a flaw in the logic of resource allocation. He was about to make a suggestion, but at that moment, the building's fire alarm system suddenly howled loudly (another "accidental" incident?). In the midst of the small chaos, the idea that had just flashed in his mind disappeared as if it had never existed. When things returned to normal, he was just a quiet young Asian, seemingly a little bewildered in the smooth operation of the Foundation. He failed to express himself again.</p>
                 <p><strong>Los Angeles.</strong></p>
                 <p>Evelyn reported the situation to Lucifer via a secure video call. "He seems... unstable, sir. Intelligent, but indecisive and easily distracted. The meeting with Davies didn't go very well." Lucifer sat in Lux's shadow, smirking slightly. "Unstable? Or is someone deliberately causing interference?" He did not rule out the possibility of intervention from the "other side". "Interesting. Keep watching. That instability could make him more vulnerable, or it could be a sign of something stronger trying to emerge. This game seems to have more layers than I thought."</p>
                 <p><strong>Heaven.</strong></p>
                 <p>Gabriel saw it all through the mist of light, his heart tightened. "Michael! What was he doing? It was blatant interference! He's sabotaging Healiangel's chances!" He turned to Uriel, his voice full of indignation and helplessness. Uriel shook his head slowly. "This is not the vandalism you think, Gabriel. Michael believes he is doing justice, stopping Lucifer. And for Healiangel, this is also part of the challenge. Will he be able to overcome his self-doubt, overcome these invisible obstacles to find his own light? Or will they fall and be swallowed up by the darkness? We can only observe and hope."</p>
                 <p>Returning to the hotel room, Hael felt exhausted and humiliated. He couldn't understand himself. Why did he become so stupid and clumsy? The ideas and desires that had just flashed were quickly extinguished. It felt like there was an invisible wall that was holding him back, or perhaps, the problem was with himself—a failure, a weakness, just like Michael saw it. The throbbing pain in the temples appeared again, and this time, the image of the shattered wings seemed a little clearer, accompanied by an unquenchable sense of regret about a strength, a potential that had been stolen. He sat down on the floor, in the middle of a luxurious but cold room, a feeling of loneliness and confusion enveloped him.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chapter" id="chapter-12">
                 <h3>Chapter 12: The Mist of Doubt</h3>
                 <p>The next few days in Los Angeles passed in a tense and confusing atmosphere. Hael tried to dismiss the feeling of failure after the first meeting, telling himself it was just fatigue from the long flight and the pressure of the new environment. But the bewilderment and feeling of being stopped by some invisible wall still smoldering in my heart. He felt like a puppet, being pulled by invisible hands.</p>
                 <p>Davies and Evelyn give him a new task: to review and evaluate some applications for emergency funding from the community. "We want your perspective and empathy, Hael," Davies said with an old smile. "Help us pick out the most deserving cases."</p>
                 <p>Hael carefully read each set of records. With a keen intuition that remains, he senses the truthfulness of the account of a single mother struggling to raise her sick child, or the despair of an elderly man who lost his home after a fire. But interspersed with that were other sets of documents, elaborate sentences evoked a sense of unreality, numbers that seemed reasonable but lacked the weight of real misery. He frowned, trying to concentrate to analyze, to listen to his instincts.</p>
                 <p>But just as he began to form his judgment, the familiar cold fog came again, covering his mind. Doubts about one's own judgment arise again. Are you being too suspicious? Was the coldness and indifference he was trying to build up making him insensitive to real pain? The image of Michael and the contemptuous eyes from Heaven reappeared. That's right, you're just a failure, how can you be qualified to judge others?</p>
                 <p><strong>Heaven.</strong></p>
                 <p>Michael's order to silence is still in effect. Raguel, in the name of "justice", continues to sow seeds of doubt and low self-esteem into Hael's mind from afar, preventing him from using his angelic intuition effectively. Michael was pleased to observe Hael's embarrassment through the orb of light. "See, Healiangel," he thought to himself, "you don't belong there, and you don't belong here. Weakness will engulf you."</p>
                 <p>As a result, Hael made conflicting assessments. He offered to assist in a case that he vaguely realized later had many suspicious points, and at the same time hesitated to refuse a situation that really needed help because of the vague doubts caused by the intervention itself. Guilt and helplessness tormented him again. What are you doing? Are you helping or causing more trouble?</p>
                 <p><strong>Heaven.</strong></p>
                 <p>Gabriel couldn't take it anymore. He turned to Uriel, who was still contemplating the universe from a ruined balcony of Heaven. "Uriel, we can't let Michael and Raguel continue to do that!" Gabriel was frustrated. "That's not justice, it's damnation! They're deliberately drowning Healiangel in the mud of inferiority and failure!" Uriel turned around, his deep eyes staring directly at Gabriel. "Justice takes many forms, Gabriel. Sometimes it's cold and harsh, as Michael interprets. But he forgot that this intervention, however cruel, was also inadvertently revealing to Healiangel the existence of the invisible forces that were ruling him. It forces him to ask questions, to look for answers that go beyond the usual human logic." "But what is the price?" Gabriel almost screamed. "He'll collapse before he finds the answer!" "Or he'll find strength in that doubt," Uriel said quietly. "Sometimes, the fog is not to hide, but to test our ability to see. Even Raphael can't heal soul wounds from afar if the subject doesn't fight on his own." He mentioned the name of the Archangel of Healing, who was probably also looking helplessly down from somewhere.</p>
                 <p><strong>Los Angeles.</strong></p>
                 <p>Evelyn smiled as she received Hael's profile review. The errors in his judgment were entirely in the background, and even benefited some of Lucifer's small plans. "He's getting more and more predictable," she reported. Lucifer just shrugged his shoulders. "Just let the guys up there play their cat-and-mouse game. Chaos sometimes creates the most exciting opportunities." He was still in no hurry to meet Hael in person. Prey needs to be "broke" more closely.</p>
                 <p>Hael was lying on the big bed in the hotel room, but his eyes were wide open and he was looking up at the ceiling. The feeling of being manipulated is becoming more and more pronounced. Empty minds, wrong decisions, abnormal emotions... It can't be just a coincidence. Something or someone was deliberately hindering him. But who is it? Lucifer? Or... Some force from where he vaguely felt he belonged? The image of the broken wings reappeared, this time more painful, like a part of the body being severed. He sat up, looking at his hands. Doubts about the outside world had now begun to turn into doubts about his own being. Who are you? And why are you here, in the midst of the vortex of these invisible forces?</p>

            <div class="chapter" id="chapter-13">
                 <h3>Chapter 13: The Shadow of the Past</h3>
                 <p>The fog was getting thicker and thicker in Hael's mind. He tried to find an explanation for the times when his mind was empty, his judgments were wrong. He went online to find out about the symptoms of temporary dementia, about anxiety disorders, but nothing really matched what he was experiencing. The feeling of being controlled and manipulated becomes obsessive. He began to doubt everything from the kindness of the people in the Morningstar Foundation to his own thoughts and feelings. The loneliness is even deeper in the luxurious but lifeless hotel room.</p>
                 <p>One afternoon, while wandering down crowded Hollywood Boulevard trying to escape the suffocation, Hael suddenly saw an elderly homeless man suddenly kneel down the side of the road, hugging his chest and breathing heavily. Everyone around hurriedly glanced by, or just stood and watched from a distance. Without a moment's hesitation, instinct rose stronger than fear, Hael rushed over. He knelt down beside the man, his hand reflexively resting on his weakly heaving chest.</p>
                 <p>A familiar flow of warmth, but this time it seemed to be stronger, purer, spreading from his palm. An extremely faint jade-green light, almost imperceptible under the bright sunlight, flashed in an instant. Hael heard the man's breathing become more regular, and his face became less pale. He opened his eyes, looking at Hael with a look of surprise and gratitude. But soon after, the familiar throbbing pain struck Hael's temple, his mind spinning, and a feeling of exhaustion hit. The memory of the last brief moment became flickering and vague. He only had time to support the man sitting against the wall before staggering to his feet, cold sweat pouring out. What did you do? What is that light?</p>
                 <p><strong>Heaven.</strong></p>
                 <p>Gabriel and Uriel both felt a faint but pure burst of energy from Hael. "He did it!" Gabriel exclaimed, a glimmer of hope flashing in his eyes. "The healing instinct is still there, stronger than Michael's intervention!" "That's right," Uriel nodded, but his expression was still not happy. "But this didn't escape Lucifer's attention either. And Michael." He looked at Raphael, who was trying to focus his healing energy toward Hael, but received only a faint response. "Raphael's energy was blocked. Michael has erected an invisible barrier around Healiangel, not only preventing help, but amplifying the negative effects." Gabriel clenched his hands. "So the hope that has just flashed is just the beginning of a bigger challenge?"</p>
                 <p>Just as Uriel had predicted, Michael felt a burst of energy. Anger flared up. "Does he dare to resist?" He orders Raguel to strengthen "justice", focusing on sowing fear and skepticism in Hael's mind after every sign of strength rising.</p>
                 <p><strong>Los Angeles.</strong></p>
                 <p>That night, Hael received a call from Evelyn. "Mr. Morningstar has returned to Los Angeles and wants to see you tonight. The bus will pick you up at 8 o'clock." Her voice was still even, but Hael felt an unusual urgency.</p>
                 <p>The luxury car takes Hael to another skyscraper, where the famous nightclub Lux is located on the top floor. Different from the flashy but somewhat artificial look of charity events, Lux has a ghostly charm, full of temptation. The lights were dim, the music was melodious but enchanting, and beautiful people passed each other in silence. Evelyn led Hael into a private elevator and went straight to Lucifer's penthouse above the club.</p>
                 <p>Lucifer Morningstar was standing by the giant glass window, looking down at the glittering night city, holding an amber wine glass in his hand. He turned around when Hael walked in, smiling familiarly but this time it seemed to have more depth, more mystery. "Hi Hael," he said, his voice echoing throughout the lavish room. "It's nice to finally see you here again, in my 'yard'." Hael stood still, trying to stay calm in the face of the overwhelming temperament of the man in front of her. "I heard that you have had some experiences... interesting in Los Angeles," Lucifer continued, stepping closer, his black eyes swirling deep into Hael. "Sudden headaches? Moments of disorientation? Or the feeling of a special ability that you can't control?" Hael was stunned. How did he know? "Don't be surprised," Lucifer laughed slightly. "I know more than you think. I know you're not like ordinary people. You're special, Hael. Very special." He stopped, looking directly into Hael's eyes. "And I can help you understand yourself. Help him control that gift, instead of being afraid of it. Help you find what you lost." The offer was like a thunderbolt in Hael's ears. Know yourself? Control the gift? Find what you lost? That's exactly what he longs for and fears. Lucifer was holding out the key that opened the mysterious door to his past, but he knew that this key was in the hands of the Devil. "Why?" Hael asked softly, his voice trembling. "Why do you want to help me?" Lucifer shrugged, a half-smile full of implications. "Because I like interesting things. And you, Healiangel... well no, Hael, you're one of the most interesting things that have fallen into this dull world. Moreover," he leaned forward, lowering his voice, "maybe we have some kind of enemy in common who is deliberately blocking your way."</p>
                 <p>Hael stood silent, his mind confused. Lucifer's offer was tempting, promising the answers he desperately sought. But instinct tells him that this is a sweet trap, a path to darkness. What choice do you have to make? Believing in the Devil to find himself, or continuing to grope in the mist of doubt or, alone against invisible forces?</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chapter" id="chapter-14">
                 <h3>Chapter 14: The Devil's Offer</h3>
                 <p>Hael stood like heaven in the middle of a lavish penthouse, his mind beeped by Lucifer's last words. Healiangel. That name echoed in his mind, strange but vaguely familiar, like touching an old wound that had not healed. Lucifer knew. He knew he was not normal, he knew about strange abilities, about the chaos inside him. And he offered to help, offered to give him the truth, the control. An offer came from the Lord of Hell.</p>
                 <p>"You... What do you know about me?" Hael stammered, trying to keep his voice calm even though his heart was beating wildly. The instinctive fear of the entity in front of him struggles violently with a burning desire to know who he is.</p>
                 <p>Lucifer smiled, a smile that was frighteningly understanding. "I know you're lost, Hael. I know you feel a great power inside but you are afraid of it, because you don't understand, you can't control it. I know you feel watched, hindered by forces that don't want you to find yourself." He walked over slowly, pouring more wine into the glass. "There are people who love order to the point of blindness, they are afraid of freedom, they are afraid of unpredictable potential. They wanted him to forever be a weak, controllable person, instead of becoming... your true self."</p>
                 <p>Lucifer's words were like needles piercing Hael's deepest suspicions. The feeling of being obstructed, the times when the mind is empty for no reason... Was it not his own weakness, but external interference? From the "orderly ones" that Lucifer was referring to? The image of Michael and the cold Heaven appeared.</p>
                 <p>"Which enemy?" Hael asked, his voice hoarse.</p>
                 <p>"Oh, you'll notice soon," Lucifer shrugged, holding his wine glass to his lips. "When you start asking the right questions. When he stopped being afraid of his power and began to seek to master it. I don't ask you to believe me right away. I have only one choice: to continue to live in the fog of fear and doubt, to be guided by those who claim to be righteous, or to step into the light—though that light may come from a place that the world calls darkness—to find your own truth and freedom."</p>
                 <p>He put down his wine glass and approached Hael, only a few steps away. The energy from him radiated intensely, both seductive and dangerous. "I can teach you how to control that energy, Hael. Teach him how to use it without exhaustion, without losing his memory. Teach him how to see through the falsehood of this world. All he needed to do was... trust."</p>
                 <p>The moment Lucifer said the word "trust", a chill suddenly ran down Hael's spine. A feeling of disgust, a red alarm sounded in his subconscious, causing him to involuntarily take a step back.</p>
                 <p><strong>Heaven.</strong></p>
                 <p>Raguel, on Michael's urgent orders, stepped up his impact. The flow of intervening energy was no longer just a distraction, but a direct activation of the instinctive fear, the last defense of the Hael soul against the primordial darkness. Michael observed, pleased to see Hael step back. "That's right, be afraid of him. That fear will keep you away from the abyss."</p>
                 <p>But Gabriel was horrified. "Do you see, Uriel?" He pointed to the orb of light, his voice trembling with anger and fear. "Michael is pushing Healiangel into Lucifer's hands! That interference only made Lucifer's words about the 'enemy in the way' even more believable! We're turning ourselves into villains in his eyes!" Uriel was silent for a long time, his complicated gaze looking at the image of Hael trembling in front of Lucifer. "Perhaps, Gabriel. Or perhaps... This is the crux of the test. Would Healiangel be wise enough to recognize the true nature behind that sweet offer, despite interference from both sides? Freedom of choice, even in the most extreme circumstances, is the ultimate power."</p>
                 <p><strong>Los Angeles.</strong></p>
                 <p>Lucifer sensed the interference from afar, as well as the intense struggle within Hael. He was not angry at all, on the contrary, he felt even more excited. He stepped back, keeping a safe distance, and his smile still didn't go out. "There's no need to make a decision right away," he said softly, his voice full of fake sympathy. "I know this is a difficult decision. Think twice, Hael. The door of this penthouse is always open to welcome you, whenever you are ready for the truth." He motioned to Evelyn, who was already waiting at the door. "Evelyn will take you back to the hotel."</p>
                 <p>Hael left Lux as a lost soul. His mind was spinning with Lucifer's words, with the feeling of fear and disgust just now, and also a faint glimmer of hope about finding himself. Who is telling the truth? Who is cheating? Who is the real enemy? Is Heaven cold, or is the Devil charming? He looked up at the night sky of Los Angeles, feeling more alone and small than ever, trapped between two giants, and most terrifyingly, he no longer knew what to believe, not even himself.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chapter" id="chapter-15">
                 <h3>Chapter 15: Echoes from Heaven</h3>
                 <p>Hael returned to the hotel, but his mind was no longer in the lavish suite. Lucifer's words, especially the name Healiangel, echoed forever. He said that there was an enemy who was hindering him. He said that there were people who blindly liked order and wanted him to be weak forever. The image of Michael and the cold Heaven appeared, which matched that allusion in a terrifying way. The feeling of betrayal, abandoned by the very place where he vaguely felt belonged, began to rekindle, intertwined with the inherent fear and doubt for Lucifer.</p>
                 <p>Unable to sit still, Hael decided to experiment. He needed to know if the feeling of being stopped was real or if it was just his imagination. That night, in a quiet hotel room, he sat flat on the floor, closed his eyes, trying to concentrate intensely. He recalled the warmth that spread when he touched the homeless man, trying to recreate that energy. He visualized the jade-green light, trying to name it in his mind: Healiangel.</p>
                 <p>Immediately, a sharp pain throbbed in his head, more intense than before. It felt like an invisible hand was squeezing his mind, preventing all efforts to concentrate. Chaotic and shattered images flashed: shattered wings, screams, a black abyss... and then everything went dark. Hael gasped, cold sweat drenched the back of his shirt. There is no doubt about it. There was a certain force that was actively stopping him, punishing him every time he tried to touch his true self. What Lucifer said was true?</p>
                 <p><strong>Heaven.</strong></p>
                 <p>Gabriel went to the garden where Raphael used to sit quietly. The once brilliant garden is now as faded as Heaven itself. "Raphael," Gabriel called softly. "I feel Healiangel's pain. He's trying... but was blocked by Michael's wall. What can you do?" Raphael, the healing angel with deeply sad eyes, shook his head. "I tried, Gabriel. My healing energy couldn't penetrate the barrier that Michael and Raguel had erected around his soul. Not only do they prevent help from us, but they amplify his fear and hurt inside. It pains my heart to see a healer again deprived of his or her abilities and suffer like that."</p>
                 <p>In another hallway, Chamuel, the angel of peace, is trying to talk to Michael. "Your severity is necessary, Governor-General, but will interfering with Healiangel's journey really bring order? Or just push him into the arms of the Fallen?" Michael turned around, his eyes as cold as ice. "Peace comes only from absolute strength and discipline, Chamuel. The weak must be eliminated or realize their mistakes. I can't let Lucifer take advantage of Healiangel. My actions are necessary to protect Heaven!" He turned away, not wanting to hear more. Michael summoned the celestial commanders, and his voice echoed throughout the Great Hall: "Strengthen discipline! Any expression of sympathy for those who have fallen will be considered rebellion!"</p>
                 <p><strong>Los Angeles.</strong></p>
                 <p>In Lux's penthouse, Lucifer was playing a game of chess alone, the black and white pieces moving at his will. Mazikeen, a loyal female warrior with black hair and sharp eyes, stood next to the report. "Hael seems to be very confused after last night's meeting. He was trying to use energy... and failed miserably. It seems like his 'old friends' over there are doing a great job pushing him towards us." Lucifer smiled slightly, moving the Black Queen. "Very good. Let Michael do the hard work for me. The stronger the repression, the more the desire for freedom burns. Hael will soon realize who really wants to 'help' him." He looked at Mazikeen. "But don't be negligent. I feel that the inherent purity within him is still very strong. Prepare for the next stage. It's time to give him a taste of some real power."</p>
                 <p>Back in the hotel room, after a severe headache, Hael fell asleep in exhaustion. And in the dream, a clearer image than any previous memory appeared. He found himself standing in a garden filled with soft light, not the harsh sunlight, but a warm, pure light. In front of him was an angel with brilliant golden wings, a sad face but a worried gaze, saying something to him. He couldn't hear the words clearly, but he felt sincere concern. It was Gabriel. Then the image faded, replaced by another angel with a gentle smile, eyes shining with wisdom and healing – Raphael? The image flashed before he could see more clearly.</p>
                 <p>Hael woke up, his heart pounding. That dream... that feeling... too honest. It was different from the cold, hostile he felt from the invisible intervention. Is it... didn't all Heaven want to harm you? Are there people who still care about you?</p>
                 <p>What is the truth? He was caught between Lucifer's tempting offer and conflicting echoes from Heaven. He couldn't believe Lucifer, but he also couldn't believe in a Heaven that seemed to be deliberately drowning him. He realized that if he wanted to find answers, he couldn't just sit back and wait or be afraid. He had to act on his own, search for himself, no matter how dangerous that path was. Perhaps, it's time to probe Evelyn and Davies more closely.</p>
                 <p>Vivid parallel memories flooded into his mind like a waterfall:</p>
                 <p>He was standing in the middle of the glorious Great Hall of Light, in front of him was the brilliant Golden Throne.</p>
                 <p>His own white, huge, and powerful wings were spreading.</p>
                 <p>Gabriel's worried face said, "Healiangel, don't do that! It's very dangerous!"</p>
                 <p>Raphael's gentle smile: "Compassion is your greatest strength, remember."</p>
                 <p>And then, the image of the Curtain cracking, he rushed towards it, the blue light enveloping it all...</p>
                 <p>"Aaaa!" Hael screamed and then fell to the floor, hugging his head. The light went out. The intense pain and exhaustion made him almost faint. But in his mind, the images just now were still clear. Wings. The name Healiangel. Gabriel. Raphael. Heaven. That's the truth. He wasn't Hael. You are Healiangel. An angel.</p>
                 <p>The office door opened. Evelyn and Davies rushed in, their faces panicked when they saw Hael lying on the floor, the computer screen still flickering. They looked at each other, then at Hael with complicated eyes, both worried and wary.</p>
                 <p><strong>Heaven.</strong></p>
                 <p>Hael's sudden burst of energy creates a ripple that spreads all the way to Heaven. Michael roared angrily, the incident was completely out of his control. Raguel trembled in fear. Gabriel and Raphael felt their brother's awakening, and hope and anxiety surged at the same time. Uriel only sighed quietly, knowing that the space chess game had just taken an unforeseen turn.</p>
                 <p><strong>Los Angeles.</strong></p>
                 <p>Lucifer was toasting with a business partner when he received an urgent message from Evelyn. He glanced at it, then smiled, a smile full of excitement and danger. "Apparently, Michael just gave me a surprise gift. Healiangel partially recalled. Very good. It's time for me to officially take action."</p>
                 <p>Hael was escorted to the hotel by Evelyn and Davies in a semi-conscious state. He lay on the bed, his eyes closed, but his mind was constantly spinning with the pieces of memories he had just recovered. You are Healiangel. But why are you here? Why lose wings and power? Why would Heaven want to hinder you? Lucifer's words about the enemy rang out again. But the image of Gabriel and Raphael in memory brings a feeling of warmth and trust. He was trapped, not only between Heaven and Hell, but also between the glorious past and the miserable mortal present. He knew he had just touched the truth, but that truth opened up a multitude of new questions and dangers.</p>
